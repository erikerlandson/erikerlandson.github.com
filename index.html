  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Scala, sequence data types support the <code>drop</code> method for skipping (aka &#8220;dropping&#8221;) the first elements of the sequence:</p>

<pre><code>// drop the first element of a list
scala&gt; List(1, 2, 3).drop(1)
res1: List[Int] = List(2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Spark RDDs also support various standard sequence methods, for example <code>filter</code>, as they are logically a sequence of row objects.  One might suppose that <code>drop</code> could be a useful sequence method for RDDs, as it would support useful idioms like:</p>

<pre><code>// Use drop (hypothetically) to skip the header of a text file:
val data = sparkContext.textFile("data.txt").drop(1)
</code></pre>

<p>Implementing <code>drop</code> for RDDs is possible, and in fact can be done with a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/compare/erikerlandson:rdd_drop_blogpost_base...rdd_drop_blogpost">small amount of code</a>, however it comes at the price of an impact to the RDD lazy computing model.</p>

<p>To see why, recall that RDDs are composed of partitions, and so in order to drop the first (n) rows of an RDD, one must first identify the partition that contains the (n-1),(n) row boundary.  In the resulting RDD, this partition will be the first one to contain any data.  Identifying this &#8220;boundary&#8221; partition cannot have a closed-form solution, because partition sizes are not in general equal;  the partition interface does not even support the concept of a <code>count</code> method.  In order to obtain the size of a partition, one is forced to actually compute its contents.  The diagram below illustrates one example of why this is so &#8211; the contents of the partitions in the filtered RDD on the right cannot be known without actually running the filter on the parent RDD:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd-drop-1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Given all this, the structure of a <code>drop</code> implementation is to compute the first partition, find its length, and see if it contains the requested (n-1),(n) boundary.  If not, compute the next partition, and so on, until the boundary partition is identified.  All prior partitions are ignored in the result.  All subsequent partitions are passed on with no change.  The boundary partition is passed through its own <code>drop</code> to eliminate rows up to (n).</p>

<p>The code implementing the concept described above can be viewed here:
<a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/compare/erikerlandson:rdd_drop_blogpost_base...rdd_drop_blogpost">https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/compare/erikerlandson:rdd_drop_blogpost_base&#8230;rdd_drop_blogpost</a></p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the relation between input and output partitions in a call to <code>drop</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd-drop-2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Arguably, this represents a potential subversion of the RDD lazy compute model, as it forces the computation of at least one (and possibly more) partitions.  It behaves like a &#8220;partial action&#8221;, instead of a transform, but an action that returns another RDD.</p>

<p>In many cases, the impact of this might be relatively small.  For example, dropping the first few rows in a text file is likely to only force computation of a single partition, and it is a partition that will eventually be computed anyway.  Furthermore, such a use case is generally not inside a tight loop.</p>

<p>However, it is not hard to construct cases where computing even the first partition of one RDD recursively forces the computation of <em>all</em> the partitions in its parents, as in this example:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd-drop-3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Whether the benefits of supporting <code>drop</code> for RDDs outweigh the costs is an open question.  It is likely to depend on whether or not the Spark community yields any compelling use cases for <code>drop</code>, and whether a transform that behaves like a &#8220;partial action&#8221; is considered an acceptable addition to the RDD formalism.</p>

<p>RDD support for <code>drop</code> has been proposed as issue <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2315">SPARK-2315</a>, with corresponding pull request <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1254/">1254</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The O(ND) edit distance algorithm <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> is a standard for efficient computation of the edit distance between two sequences, appearing in applications such as the GNU diff tool.  There is also a variation <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> that operates in O(NP) time, where P is the number of deletions in the shortest edit path, and which has lower computational complexity, since P &lt;= D (and may be &lt;&lt; D in some circumstances).  In order to apply these algorithms to obtain an <em>edit script</em> in linear space, they must be adapted into a bidirectional form that enables recursive divide-and-conquer.   The basic principles of a bidirectional adaptation of the O(ND) algorithm are described in <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.   However, no such discussion of a bidirectional O(NP) algorithm is provided in <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.  Understanding this adaptation involves some observations that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious.  In this post, I will describe these key observations.</p>

<h3>Notation</h3>

<p>My code segments are written as C/C++, however written in a simplified style I hope will be clear regardless of what languages the reader is familiar with.  If you wish to port this (pseudo-ish)code, it may be worth keeping in mind that indexing is zero-based in C/C++.</p>

<h3>Sequence Lengths</h3>

<p>A brief note on the O(NP) algorithm and sequence lengths: the algorithm assumes that the length of its second sequence argument is >= its first (that is, N >= M).   In the following discussions, I will be making the same assumption, however the modification to address N &lt; M is relatively easy, and can be seen in the references to actual source code below.</p>

<h3>Indexing</h3>

<p>A note on naming:  In <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, the authors use &#8216;fp&#8217; for the name of the array holding path endpoints.  I will use &#8216;Vf&#8217; for the array holding forward endpoints, and &#8216;Vr&#8217; for the corresponding array holding reverse endpoints.</p>

<p>The O(ND) and O(NP) algorithms operate by iteratively extending the frontier of edit paths through the implicit graph of possible paths, where each iteration is computed as a function of the previous.  In the O(NP) algorithm, this computation has to proceed from the outside in, as described in the paper:</p>

<pre><code>for (k = -P;  k &lt; delta;  k += 1) {
    y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
    Vf[k] = snake(y-k, y);
}
for (k = P + delta;  k &gt;= delta;  k -= 1) {
    y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
    Vf[k] = snake(y-k, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to implement a bi-directional algorithm, we must also run the algorithm in reverse, beginning at the &#8220;lower right corner&#8221; of the graph (M,N) and working backward to the origin (0,0).  The indexing is the mirror image of the above:</p>

<pre><code>for (k = P+delta;  k &gt; 0;  k -= 1) {
    y = min(Vr[k-1], Vr[k+1] - 1);
    Vr[k] = rsnake(y-k, y);
}
for (k = -P;  k &lt;= 0;  k += 1) {
    y = min(Vr[k-1], Vr[k+1] - 1);
    Vr[k] = rsnake(y-k, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, &#8216;rsnake&#8217; is the reverse-direction snake function.  A note on initialization:  whereas the forward algorithm initializes its Vf array to (-1), the symmetric initial value for the reverse algorithm Vr array is (N+1) (In the general case, 1 plus the length of the longest sequence).</p>

<h3>Detecting Path Overlap</h3>

<p>The uni-directional O(NP) algorithm halts when Vf[delta] == N.  However, the bi-directional algorithms halt when shortest opposing paths meet &#8211; or overlap &#8211; each other, as described in the O(ND) paper <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.  The semantics of storing paths in working arrays is the same in both algorithms, with the exception that in the O(NP) algorithm it is the (y) values that are stored.  Myers describes the predicate for detecting meeting paths in O(ND) as: (x >= u)  &amp;&amp;  (x-y == u-v), where (x,y) are forward endpoints and (u,v) are reverse endpoints.  Observe that since y = x-k, then (x-y == u-v) is equivalent to &#8220;forward-k == reverse-k&#8221;.  However, in operation one always checks the opposing path with the <em>same</em> k index, and so this clause is redundant.  It is sufficient to check that (x >= u), or in the case of O(NP), that (y >= v).  In the code, this looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
    // overlapping paths detected 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The other checks for forward and reverse are similar.  Note that these checks happen at the <em>beginning</em> of each &#8216;snake&#8217;, that is prior to invoking the snake extension logic.  The semantic is that the opposing path overlaps the run (snake) one is about to start.</p>

<h3>Computing Distance</h3>

<p>When two overlapping paths are detected, we must compute the path distance associated with their union.  In the O(ND) algorithm, we know that distance implicitly, as the paths are extended over successive iterations of D.  In the O(NP) algorithm, however, the current path endpoints are associated with a particular value of P, and so we must consider how to obtain the actual distance.</p>

<p>A little algebra comes to the rescue.  At iteration P, consider the number of deletions along the forward-path at the kth endpoint, which I will denote as &#8216;vf&#8217; (the authors refer to it as V(x,y)).  In <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, the authors show that P == vf when k &lt; delta, and P == vf+k-delta, when k > delta (note that either formula applies for k == delta).  Solving for vf, we have:   vf == P for k &lt; delta and vf == P+delta-k for k > delta.  The authors also show that: vf = (df-k)/2, where df is the total edit distance along the path up to the current endpoint (the authors refer to df as D(x,y)).   Therefore, we have: df = 2(vf)+k, where we can obtain vf from the expression we just derived.</p>

<p>It remains to derive the expressions for the reverse direction, where we want &#8216;vr&#8217; and &#8216;dr&#8217;.  Here, I note that the mirror-image indexing of the reverse algorithm implies that the expressions above work if we transform k &#8211;> delta-k.  Making that transform gives us:   vr == P for k > 0 and vr == P+k for k &lt; 0 (again, either applies for k == 0).  And dr = 2(vr)+delta-k.</p>

<p>And so the actual edit distance covered by our overlapping paths is:  d == (df+dr) == 2(vf+vr)+delta.  Note now pleasing this is, as vf+vr is the number of deletions of the combined paths, and so this corresponds to the original formula D == 2P+delta, where P is the number of deletions over the entire pathway.  We also see from the above that at a given Pth iteration, P does <em>not</em> equal the number of deletions in all paths with endpoints at the current iteration.  The true number of deletions for a given endpoint is a function of P, k and delta.</p>

<p>A note on implementation: when one is advancing forward paths, an overlapping reverse-path will be from previous iteration (P-1), as the reverse paths for (P) have not happened yet.  That will show up in the distance formula for (vr) by using (P-1) in place of P, as in this example code:</p>

<pre><code>y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
    // we found overlapping path, so compute corresponding edit distance
    vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
    // use (P-1) for reverse paths:
    vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P-1 + k) : P-1;
    d = 2*(vf+vr)+delta;
}

// ....

y = min(Vr[k-1], Vr[k+1] - 1);
if (y &lt;= Vf[k]) {
    // we can use P for both since forward-paths have been advanced:
    vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
    vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P + k) : P;
    d = 2*(vf+vr)+delta;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Shortest Path</h3>

<p>With respect to halting conditions, the O(NP) algorithm differs in one imporant way from the O(ND) algorithm: The O(ND) algorithm maintains path endpoints corresponding to increasing <em>distance</em> (D) values.  Therefore, when two paths meet, they form a shortest-distance path by definition, and the algorithm can halt on the first such overlap it detects.</p>

<p>The same is <em>not true</em> for the O(NP) algorithm.  It stores endpoints at a particular P value.  However, at a given value of P, actual <em>distances</em> may vary considerably.  On a given iteration over P, actual path distances may vary from 2(P-1)+delta up to 4P+delta.</p>

<p>This problem is dealt with by maintaining a best-known distance, &#8216;Dbest&#8217;, which is initialized to its maximum possible value of N+M, the sum of both sequence lengths.  Whenever two overlapping paths are detected, their corresponding distance &#8216;d&#8217; is computed as described earlier, and the running minimum is maintainted:  Dbest = min(Dbest,d).  As mentioned above, we know that the mimimum possible distance at a given iteration is Dmin = 2(P-1)+delta, and so when Dmin >= Dbest, we halt and return Dbest as our result.</p>

<h3>Loop Bounding</h3>

<p>Some important computational efficiency can be obtained by reorganizing the looping over the endpoints.   As mentioned above, conceptually the looping proceeds from the outside, inward.  Suppose we organize the looping over k values such that we explore k = {-P, P+delta, -P+1, P+delta-1, -P+2, P+delta-2 &#8230; }  Note that the symmetry breaks a bit when we get to k==delta, as here we stop iterating backward, but continue iterating forward until we hit delta from below.  In the code, this looping pattern looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>// advance forward paths: reverse path looping is similar
for (ku = -P, kd = P+delta;  ku &lt;= delta;  ku += 1) {
    // advance diagonals from -P, upwards:
    y = max(1+Vf[ku-1], Vf[ku+1]);

    // check for overlapping path

    Vf[ku] = snake(y-ku, y);

    // stop searching backward past here:
    if (kd &lt;= delta) continue;

    // advance diagonals from P+delta, downwards:
    y = max(1+Vf[kd-1], Vf[kd+1]);

    // check for overlapping path

    Vf[kd] = snake(y-kd, y);
    kd -= 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is method to this madness.  Observe that for any particular P value, the smallest edit distances are at the outside, and get larger as one moves inward.  The minimum distance 2P+delta is always when k == -P, and k == P+delta.  As we proceed inward, the corresponding edit distance increases towards its maximum of 4P+delta.   This allows <em>two</em> optimizations.  The first is that if we hit an overlapping path, we can now exit the loop immediately, as we know that any other such overlapping paths to our inside will have a larger edit distance, and so do not need to be considered.</p>

<p>The second optimization is to recall that path distances are a function of P, k and delta.  We can use this information to solve for k and obtain a useful adaptive bound on how far we loop.  From previous sections, also recall we are keeping a best-known distance Dbest.  We know that we do not have to explore any paths whose distance is >= Dbest.  So, we can set up the following inequality: 2(vf+vr)+delta &lt; Dbest, where vf = P, and vr = (P-1)+k, where k &lt; 0, which is the region where distance is growing.  Therefore, we have 2(P+(P-1)+k)+delta &lt; Dbest.  Solving for k, we have:  k &lt; ((Dbest-delta)/2)-2P+1.  The looping wants to use &#8216;&lt;=&#8217;, so we can rewrite as: k &lt;= ((Dbest-delta-1)/2)-2P+1.  For the reverse-path looping, we can set up a similar inequality:  2(P+P+delta-k)+delta &lt; Dbest, which yields:  k >= ((1+delta-Dbest)/2)+delta+2P.</p>

<p>Note that if these bound expressions evaluate to a value past the nominal bound, then the nominal bound remains in effect: e.g. the operative forward looping bound = min(delta, ((Dbest-delta)/2)-2P).   Also note that these constraints do not break the computation of the endpoints, because when the bounds move, they always retreat toward the outside by 2 on each iteration of P.  Since computation proceeds outside in, that means the necessary values are always correctly populated from the previous iteration.</p>

<p>In the code, the forward path looping looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>// compute our adaptive loop bound (using P-1 for reverse)
bound = min(delta, ((Dbest-delta-1)/2)-(2*P)+1);

// constrain our search by bound:
for (ku = -P, kd = P+delta;  ku &lt;= bound;  ku += 1) {
    y = max(1+Vf[ku-1], Vf[ku+1]);
    if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
        vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
        vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P-1 + k) : P-1;

        // maintain minimum distance:
        Dbest = min(Dbest, 2*(vf+vr)+delta);

        // we can now halt this loop immediately:
        break;
    }

    Vf[ku] = snake(y-ku, y);

    if (kd &lt;= delta) continue;

    y = max(1+Vf[kd-1], Vf[kd+1]);
    if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
        vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
        vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P-1 + k) : P-1;

        // maintain minimum distance:
        Dbest = min(Dbest, 2*(vf+vr)+delta);

        // we can now halt this loop immediately:
        break;
    }

    Vf[kd] = snake(y-kd, y);
    kd -= 1;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>In conclusion, I will display a code segment with all of the ideas presented above, coming together.  This segment was taken from my <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/algorithm/blob/order_np_alg/include/boost/algorithm/sequence/detail/edit_distance.hpp#L342">working prototype code</a>, with some syntactic clutter removed and variable names changed to conform a bit more closely to <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.  The implementation of O(NP) below is performing about 25% faster than the corresponding O(ND) algorithm in my benchmarking tests, and also uses substantially less memory.</p>

<pre><code>// initialize this with the maximum possible distance:
Dbest = M+N;

P = 0;
while (true) {
    // the minimum possible distance for the current P value
    Dmin = 2*(P-1) + delta;

    // if the minimum possible distance is &gt;= our best-known distance, we can halt
    if (Dmin &gt;= Dbest) return Dbest;

    // adaptive bound for the forward looping
    bound = min(delta, ((Dbest-delta-1)/2)-(2*P)+1);

    // advance forward diagonals
    for (ku = -P, kd = P+delta;  ku &lt;= bound;  ku += 1) {
        y = max(1+Vf[ku-1], Vf[ku+1]);
        x = y-ku;

        // path overlap detected
        if (y &gt;= Vr[ku]) {
            vf = (ku&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - ku) : P;
            vr = (ku&lt;0) ? (P-1 + ku) : P-1;
            Dbest = min(Dbest, 2*(vf+vr)+delta);
            break;
        }

        // extend forward snake
        if (N &gt;= M) {
            while (x &lt; M  &amp;&amp;  y &lt; N  &amp;&amp;  equal(S1[x], S2[y])) { x += 1;  y += 1; }
        } else {
            while (x &lt; N  &amp;&amp;  y &lt; M  &amp;&amp;  equal(S1[y], S2[x])) { x += 1;  y += 1; }
        }

        Vf[ku] = y;

        if (kd &lt;= delta) continue;

        y = max(1+Vf[kd-1], Vf[kd+1]);
        x = y-kd;

        // path overlap detected
        if (y &gt;= Vr[kd]) {
            vf = (kd&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - kd) : P;
            vr = (kd&lt;0) ? (P-1 + kd) : P-1;
            Dbest = min(Dbest, 2*(vf+vr)+delta);
            break;
        }

        // extend forward snake

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_1Introduction.html#8555">HTCondor negotiator</a> assigns jobs (resource requests) to slots (compute resources) at regular intervals, configured by the <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_3Configuration.html#20544">NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL</a> parameter.  This interval (the cycle <em>cadence</em>) has a fundamental impact on a pool <em>loading factor</em> &#8211; the fraction of time that slots are being productively utilized.</p>

<p>Consider the following diagram, which illustrates the utilization of a slot over the lifetime of a job.  When a job completes, its slot will remain empty until it can be assigned a new job on the next negotiation cycle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/slot_load_study/loading_factor_diagram.png" width="750"></p>

<p>As the diagram above shows, the loading factor for a slot can be expressed as D/Z, where D is the duration of the job, and Z is the total time until the next cycle occurring after the job completes.  We can also write Z = D+I, where I is the &#8220;idle time&#8221; from job completion to the start of the next negotiation cycle.   Loading factor is always &lt;= 1, where a value of 1 corresponds to ideal loading &#8211; every slot is utilized 100% of the time.  In general, loading will be &lt; 1, as jobs rarely complete exactly on a cycle boundary.</p>

<p>It is worth briefly noting that the <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_3Configuration.html#18202">claim reuse</a> feature was developed to help address this problem.  However, claim re-use is not compatible with all other features &#8211; for example enabling claim re-use can cause accounting group starvation &#8211; and so what follows remains relevant to many HTCondor configurations.</p>

<p>Given a particular negotiation cycle cadence, how does a slot&#8217;s loading factor behave, as a function of job duration?  The loading factor can be expressed as:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
&#92;text{Loading Factor} = &#92;frac{D}{C &#92;left( q + &#92;lceil r &#92;rceil &#92;right)} &#92;&#92;
 &#92;&#92;
&#92;text{where:} &#92;&#92;
D = &#92;text{job duration} &#92;&#92;
C = &#92;text{cycle cadence} &#92;&#92;
q = &#92;lfloor D / C &#92;rfloor &#92;&#92;
r = &#92;left( D / C &#92;right) - q &#92;&#92;
&#92;]
</div>


<p>The following plot illustrates how the loading factor changes with job duration, assuming a cadence of 300 seconds (5 minutes):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/slot_load_study/load_factor_300s.png" width="750"></p>

<p>We immediately see that there is a saw-tooth pattern to the plot.  As the job duration increases towards the boundary of a cycle, there is less and less idle time until the next cycle, and so the loading approaches 1.0.  However, once the job&#8217;s end crosses the thresold to <em>just past</em> the start of the cycle, it immediately drops to the worse possible case: the slot will be idle for nearly an entire cycle.</p>

<p>The other important pattern is that the bottom of the saw-tooth gradually increases.  As a job&#8217;s duration occupies more whole negotiation cycles, the idle time at the end of the last cycle represents a decreasing fraction of the total time.</p>

<p>Observe that the most important &#8216;unit&#8217; in this plot is the number of negotiation cycles.  Since the saw-toothing scales with the cycle interval, we can express the same plot in units of cycles instead of seconds:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/slot_load_study/load_factor_cu.png" width="750"></p>

<p>The results above suggest a couple possible approaches for tuning negotiator cycle cadence to optimize slot loading in an HTCondor pool.  The first is to configure the negotiator interval to be small relative to a typical job duration, as the lower-bound on loading factor increases with the number of cycles a job&#8217;s duration occupies.  For example, if a typical job duration is 10 minutes, then a cycle cadence of 60 seconds ensures that in general 9 out of 10 cycles will be fully utilized, and so loading will be around 90%.  However, if one has mostly very short jobs, this can be difficult, as negotiation cycle cadences much less than 60 seconds may risk causing performance problems even on a moderately loaded pool.</p>

<p>A second approach is to try and tune the cadence so that as many jobs as possible complete <em>near the end</em> of a cycle, thus minimizing delay until the next cycle.  For example, if job durations are relatively consistent, say close to 90 seconds, then setting the negotiator interval to something like 50 seconds will induce those jobs to finish near the end of the 2nd negotiation cycle (at t+100 seconds), for a loading factor around 90%.  The caveat here is that job durations are frequently <em>not</em> that consistent, and as job duration spread increases, one&#8217;s ability to play this game <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2013/03/15/examining-the-modulus-of-random-variables/">rapidly evaporates</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, I have focused on the behavior of individual jobs and individual slots.  An obvious next question is what happens to aggregate pool loading when job durations are treated as population sampling from random variables, which I plan to explore in future posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the advantages of cubic Hermite splines is that their interval interpolation formula is an explicit function of gradients \( m_0, m_1, &#8230; m_{n-1} \) at knot-points:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
y(t) = h_{00}(t) y_j + h_{10}(t) m_j + h_{01}(t) y_{j+1} + h_{11}(t) m_{j+1} &#92;&#92;
&#92;]
</div>


<p>where the Hermite bases are:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
h_{00} = 2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1 &#92;&#92;
h_{10} = t^3 - 2t^2 + t &#92;&#92;
h_{01} = -2t^3 + 3t^2 &#92;&#92;
h_{11} = t^3 - t^2 &#92;&#92;
&#92;]
</div>


<p>(For now, I will be using the unit-interval form of the interpolation, where t runs from 0 to 1 on each interval.  I will also discuss the non-uniform interval equations below)</p>

<p>This formulation allows one to explicitly specify the interpolation gradient at each knot point, and to choose from various gradient assignment policies, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline#Interpolating_a_data_set">those listed here</a>, even supporting policies for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_cubic_interpolation">enforcing monotonic interpolations</a>.</p>

<p>One important caveat with cubic Hermite splines is that although the gradient \( y&#8217;(t) \) is guaranteed to be continuous, it is <em>not</em> guaranteed to be smooth (that is, differentiable) <em>across</em> the knots (it is of course smooth <em>inside</em> each interval). Therefore, another useful category of gradient policy is to obtain gradients \( m_0, m_1, &#8230; m_{n-1} \) such that \( y&#8217;(t) \) is also smooth across knots.</p>

<p>(I feel sure that what follows was long since derived elsewhere, but my attempts to dig the formulation up on the internet failed, and so I decided the derivation might make a useful blog post)</p>

<p>To ensure smooth gradient across knot points, we want the 2nd derivative \( y&#8221;(t) \) to be equal at the boundaries of adjacent intervals:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
h_{00}^&#8221;(t) y_{j-1} + h_{10}^&#8221;(t) m_{j-1} + h_{01}^&#8221;(t) y_j + h_{11}^&#8221;(t) m_j &#92;&#92;
= &#92;&#92;
h_{00}^&#8221;(t) y_j + h_{10}^&#8221;(t) m_j + h_{01}^&#8221;(t) y_{j+1} + h_{11}^&#8221;(t) m_{j+1}
&#92;]
</div>


<p>or substituting the 2nd derivative of the basis definitions above:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
&#92;left( 12 t - 6 &#92;right) y_{j-1} + &#92;left( 6 t - 4 &#92;right) m_{j-1}  + &#92;left( 6 - 12 t &#92;right) y_j + &#92;left( 6 t - 2 &#92;right) m_j &#92;&#92;
= &#92;&#92;
&#92;left( 12 t - 6 &#92;right) y_{j} + &#92;left( 6 t - 4 &#92;right) m_{j}  + &#92;left( 6 - 12 t &#92;right) y_{j+1} + &#92;left( 6 t - 2 &#92;right) m_{j+1}
&#92;]
</div>


<p>Observe that t = 1 on the left hand side of this equation, and t = 0 on the right side, and so we have:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
6 y_{j-1} + 2 m_{j-1} - 6 y_j + 4 m_j
=
-6 y_j - 4 m_j + 6 y_{j+1} - 2 m_{j+1}
&#92;]
</div>


<p>which we can rearrange as:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
2 m_{j-1} + 8 m_j + 2 m_{j+1}
=
6 &#92;left( y_{j+1} - y_{j-1} &#92;right)
&#92;]
</div>


<p>Given n knot points, the above equation holds for j = 1 to n-2 (using zero-based indexing, as nature intended).  Once we define equations for j = 0 and j = n-1, we will have a system of equations to solve.  There are two likely choices.  The first is to simply specify the endpoint gradients \( m_0 = G \) and \( m_{n-1} = H \) directly, which yields the following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm">tri-diagonal matrix equation:</a></p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
&#92;left( &#92;begin{array} {ccccc}
1 &   &   &   &   &#92;&#92;
2 & 8 & 2 &   &   &#92;&#92;
  & 2 & 8 & 2 &   &#92;&#92;
  &   & &#92;vdots &   &   &#92;&#92;
  &   & 2 & 8 & 2 &#92;&#92; 
  &   &   &   & 1 &#92;&#92;
&#92;end{array} &#92;right)

&#92;left( &#92;begin{array} {c}
m_0 &#92;&#92;
m_1 &#92;&#92;
 &#92;&#92;
&#92;vdots &#92;&#92;
 &#92;&#92;
m_{n-1}
&#92;end{array} &#92;right)
=
&#92;left( &#92;begin{array} {c}
G &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_2 - y_0 &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_3 - y_1 &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
&#92;vdots &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_{n-1} - y_{n-3} &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
H &#92;&#92;
&#92;end{array} &#92;right)
&#92;]
</div>


<p>The second common endpoint policy is to set the 2nd derivative equal to zero &#8211; the &#8220;natural spline.&#8221;   Setting the 2nd derivative to zero at the left-end knot (and t = 0) gives us:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
4 m_0 + 2 m_1   =   6 &#92;left( y_1 - y_0 &#92;right)
&#92;]
</div>


<p>Similarly, at the right-end knot (t = 1), we have:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
2 m_0 + 4 m_1   =   6 &#92;left( y_{n-1} - y_{n-2} &#92;right)
&#92;]
</div>


<p>And so for a natural spline endpoint policy the matrix equation looks like this:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
&#92;left( &#92;begin{array} {ccccc}
4 & 2 &   &   &   &#92;&#92;
2 & 8 & 2 &   &   &#92;&#92;
  & 2 & 8 & 2 &   &#92;&#92;
  &   & &#92;vdots &   &   &#92;&#92;
  &   & 2 & 8 & 2 &#92;&#92; 
  &   &   & 2 & 4 &#92;&#92;
&#92;end{array} &#92;right)

&#92;left( &#92;begin{array} {c}
m_0 &#92;&#92;
m_1 &#92;&#92;
 &#92;&#92;
&#92;vdots &#92;&#92;
 &#92;&#92;
m_{n-1}
&#92;end{array} &#92;right)
=
&#92;left( &#92;begin{array} {c}
6 &#92;left( y_1 - y_0 &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_2 - y_0 &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_3 - y_1 &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
&#92;vdots &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_{n-1} - y_{n-3} &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
6 &#92;left( y_{n-1} - y_{n-2} &#92;right) &#92;&#92;
&#92;end{array} &#92;right)
&#92;]
</div>


<p>The derivation above is for uniform (and unit) intervals, where t runs from 0 to 1 on each knot interval.  I&#8217;ll now discuss the variation where knot intervals are non-uniform.   The non-uniform form of the interpolation equation is:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
y(x) = h_{00}(t) y_j + h_{10}(t) d_j m_j + h_{01}(t) y_{j+1} + h_{11}(t) d_j m_{j+1} &#92;&#92;
&#92;text{ } &#92;&#92;
&#92;text{where:} &#92;&#92;
&#92;text{ }  &#92;&#92;
d_j = x_{j+1} - x_j &#92;text{  for  } j = 0, 1, &#8230; n-2 &#92;&#92;
t = (x - x_j) / d_j
&#92;]
</div>


<p>Taking \( t = t(x) \) and applying the chain rule, we see that 2nd derivative equation now looks like:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
y&#8221;(x) = &#92;frac { &#92;left( 12 t - 6 &#92;right) y_{j} + &#92;left( 6 t - 4 &#92;right) d_j m_{j}  + &#92;left( 6 - 12 t &#92;right) y_{j+1} + &#92;left( 6 t - 2 &#92;right) d_j m_{j+1} } { d_j^2 }
&#92;]
</div>


<p>Applying a derivation similar to the above, we find that our (interior) equations look like this:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
&#92;frac {2} { d_{j-1} }  m_{j-1} + &#92;left( &#92;frac {4} { d_{j-1} } + &#92;frac {4} { d_j } &#92;right) m_j + &#92;frac {2} {d_j} m_{j+1}
=
&#92;frac { 6 &#92;left( y_{j+1} - y_{j} &#92;right) } { d_j^2 } + &#92;frac { 6 &#92;left( y_{j} - y_{j-1} &#92;right) } { d_{j-1}^2 }
&#92;]
</div>


<p>and natural spline endpoint equations are:</p>

<div markdown="0">
&#92;[
&#92;text{left:  } &#92;frac {4} {d_0} m_0 + &#92;frac {2} {d_0} m_1   =   &#92;frac {6 &#92;left( y_1 - y_0 &#92;right)} {d_0^2} &#92;&#92;
&#92;text{right: } &#92;frac {2} {d_{n-2}} m_0 + &#92;frac {4} {d_{n-2}} m_1   =   &#92;frac {6 &#92;left( y_{n-1} - y_{n-2} &#92;right)} {d_{n-2}^2}
&#92;]
</div>


<p>And so the matrix equation for specified endpoint gradients is:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The original motivation for these experiments was consideration of the impact of negotiator cycle cadence (i.e. the time between the start of one cycle and the start of the next) on HTCondor pool loading.  Specifically, any HTCondor job that completes and vacates its resource may leave that resource unloaded until it can be re-matched on the next cycle.  Therefore, the duration of resource vacancies (and hence, pool loading) can be thought of as a function of job durations <em>modulo</em> the cadence of the negotiator cycle.  In general, the aggregate behavior of job durations on a pool is useful to model as a random variable.  And so, it seemed worthwhile to build up a little intuition about the behavior of a random variable when you take its modulus.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>I took a Monte Carlo approach to this study because a tractable theoretical framework eluded me, and you do not have to dive very deep to show that <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2013/01/02/the-mean-of-the-modulus-does-not-equal-the-modulus-of-the-mean/">even trivial random variable behavior under a modulus is dependent on the distribution</a>.   A Monte Carlo framework for the study also allows for other underlying distributions to be easily studied, by altering the random variable being sampled.   In the interest of getting right into results, I&#8217;ll briefly discuss the tools I used at the end of this post.</p>

<h3>Modulus and Variance</h3>

<p>Consider what happens to a random variable&#8217;s modulus as its variance increases.  This sequence of plots shows that the modulus of a normal distribution tends toward a uniform distribution over the modulus interval, as the underlying variance increases:</p>

<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<p>From the above plots, we can see that in the case of a normal distribution, its modulus tends toward uniform rather quickly - by the time the underlying variance is half of the modulus interval.</p>

<p>The following plots demonstrate the same effect with a one-tailed distribution (the exponential) &#8211; it requires a larger variance for the effect to manifest.</p>

<p>A third example, using a log-normal distribution.   The variance of the log-normal increases as a function of both \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \).  In this example \( \mu \) is increased systematically, holding \( \sigma \) constant at 1:</p>

<thead>

<td align="center">  <img src="/assets/images/rv_mod_study/lognormal_2.0_1.0.png" width="375" height="375">  |</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<br>


<p>For a final examination of variance, I will again use log-normals and this time vary \( \sigma \), while holding \( \mu \) constant at 0.  Here we see that the effect of increasing the log-normal variance via \( \sigma \) does <em>not</em> follow the pattern in previous examples &#8211; the distribution does not &#8216;spread&#8217; and its modulus does not evolve toward a uniform distribution!</p>

<h3>Modulus and Mean</h3>

<p>The following table of plots demonstrates the decreasing effect that a distribution&#8217;s location (mean) has, as its spread increases and its modulus approaches uniformity.   In fact, we see that <em>any</em> distribution in the &#8216;uniform modulus&#8217; parameter region is indistinguishable from any other, with respect to its modulus &#8211; all changes to mean or variance <em>within</em> this region have no affect on the distribution&#8217;s modulus!</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Generally, as the spread of a distribution increases, its modulus tends toward a uniform distribution on the modulus interval.   Although it was tempting to state this in terms of increasing variance, we see from the 2nd log-normal experiment that variance can increase without increasing &#8216;spread&#8217; in a way that causes the trend toward uniform modulus.   Currently, I&#8217;m not sure what the true invariant is, that properly distinguishes the 2nd log-normal scenario from the others.</p>

<p>For any distribution that <em>does</em> reside in the &#8216;uniform-modulus&#8217; parameter space, we see that neither changes to location nor spread (nor even category of distribution) can be distinguished by the distribution modulus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been considering models for the effects of HTCondor negotiation cycle cadence on pool loading and accounting group starvation, which led me to thinking about the effects of taking the modulus of a random variable, for reasons I plan to discuss in future posts.</p>

<p>When you take the modulus of a random variable, X, the corresponding expected value E[X mod m] is not equal to E[X] mod m.  Consider the following example:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rv_modulus_mean.png" title="An example demonstrating that E[X mod m] != E[X] mod m" alt="Random Variable Images" /></p>

<p>As we see from the example above, the random variables X and Y have the same mean:  E[X] = E[Y] = 0.75, however E[X mod 1] = 0.75 while E[Y mod 1] = 0.5.  One implication is that computing the moments of the modulus of random variables must be on a per-distribution basis, perhaps via monte carlo methods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>HTCondor supports a notion of aggregate compute resources known as partitionable slots (p-slots), which may be consumed by multiple jobs.   Historically, at most one job could be matched against such a slot in a single negotiation cycle, which limited the rate at which partitionable slot resources could be utilized.  More recently, the scheduler has been enhanced with logic to allow it to acquire multiple claims against a partitionable slot, which increases the p-slot utilization rate. However, as this potentially bypasses the negotiator&#8217;s accounting of global pool resources such as accounting group quotas and concurrency limits, it places some contraints on what jobs can can safely acquire multiple claims against any particular p-slot: for example, only other jobs on the same scheduler can be considered.  Additionally, candidate job requirements must match the requirements of the job that originally matched in the negotiator.  Another significant impact is that the negotiator is still forced to match an entire p-slot, which may have a large match cost (weight): these large match costs cause <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">accounting difficulties</a> when submitter shares and/or group quotas drop below the cost of a slot.  This particular problem is growing steadily larger, as machines with ever-larger numbers of cores and other resources appear in HTCondor pools.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to scheduler-side resource consumption is to enhance the negotiator with the ability to match multiple jobs against a resource (p-slot) &#8211; negotiator-side resource consumption.   The advantages of negotiator-side consumption are that it places fewer limitations on what jobs can consume a given resource.  The negotiator already handles global resource accounting, and so jobs are not required to adhere to the same requirements expression to safely consume assets from the same resource.  Furthermore, jobs from any scheduler may be considered.  Each match is only charged the cost of resources consumed, and so p-slots with large amounts of resources do not cause difficulties with large match costs.   Another considerable benefit of this approach is that it facilitates the support of <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/no-longer-thinking-in-slots-thinking-in-aggregate-resources-and-consumption-policies/">configurable resource consumption policies</a></p>

<p>I have developed a working draft of negotiator-side resource consumption on my HTCondor github fork, topic branch <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/htcondor/tree/V7_9-prototype-negside-pslot-splits">V7_9-prototype-negside-pslot-splits</a> which also implements support for configurable resource consumption policies.   I will briefly demonstrate this implementation and some of its advantages below.</p>

<p>First I will demonstrate an example with a consumption policy that is essentially equivalent to HTCondor&#8217;s current default policies.  Consider this configuration:</p>

<pre><code># spoof some cores
NUM_CPUS = 10

# configure an aggregate resource (p-slot) to consume
SLOT_TYPE_1 = 100%
SLOT_TYPE_1_PARTITIONABLE = True
# declare multiple claims for negotiator to use
# may also use global: NUM_CLAIMS
SLOT_TYPE_1_NUM_CLAIMS = 20
NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 1

# turn off schedd-side resource splitting since we're demonstrating neg-side alternative
CLAIM_PARTITIONABLE_LEFTOVERS = False

# turn this off to demonstrate that consumption policy will handle this kind of logic
MUST_MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS = False

# configure a consumption policy.   This policy is modeled on
# current 'modify-request-exprs' defaults:
# "my" is resource ad, "target" is job ad
STARTD_EXPRS = ConsumptionCpus, ConsumptionMemory, ConsumptionDisk
ConsumptionCpus = quantize(target.RequestCpus, {1})
ConsumptionMemory = quantize(target.RequestMemory, {128})
ConsumptionDisk = quantize(target.RequestDisk, {1024})
# swap doesn't seem to be actually supported in resource accounting

# keep slot weights enabled for match costing
NEGOTIATOR_USE_SLOT_WEIGHTS = True

# weight used to derive match cost: W(before-consumption) - W(after-consumption)
SlotWeight = Cpus

# for simplicity, turn off preemption, caching, worklife
CLAIM_WORKLIFE=0
MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME = 3600
PREEMPT = False
RANK = 0
PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS = False
NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION = False
NEGOTIATOR_MATCHLIST_CACHING = False

# verbose logging
ALL_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG

# reduce daemon update latencies
NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL = 30
SCHEDD_INTERVAL = 15
</code></pre>

<p>In the above configuration, we declare a typical aggregate (that is, partitionable) resource <code>SLOT_TYPE_1</code>, but then we also configure a <em>consumption policy</em>, by advertising <code>ConsumptionCpus</code>, <code>ConsumptionMemory</code> and <code>ConsumptionDisk</code>.  Note that these are defined with quantizing expressions currently used as default values for the <code>MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS</code> behavior.  The startd and the negotiatior will <em>both</em> use these expressions by examining the slot ads.</p>

<p>Next, we submit 15 jobs.  Note that this more than the 10 cores advertised by the p-slot:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = 60
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
queue 15
</code></pre>

<p>If we watch the negotiator log, we will see that negotiator matches the 10 jobs supported by the p-slot on the next cycle (note that it uses slot1 each time):</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-'  -e 'matched
12/03/12 11:53:10 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 11:53:25 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------

12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>condor_q</code> to verify that the 10 jobs subsequently run.   The jobs run against 10 dynamic slots (d-slots) in the standard way:</p>

<pre><code>$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotCpus
slot1@rorschach | 10
slot1_10@rorschach | 1
slot1_1@rorschach | 1
slot1_2@rorschach | 1
slot1_3@rorschach | 1
slot1_4@rorschach | 1
slot1_5@rorschach | 1
slot1_6@rorschach | 1
slot1_7@rorschach | 1
slot1_8@rorschach | 1
slot1_9@rorschach | 1
</code></pre>

<p>Next we consider altering the resource consumption policy.  As a simple example, suppose we wish to allocate memory more coarsely.  We could alter the configuration above by changing <code>ConsumptionMemory</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>ConsumptionMemory = quantize(target.RequestMemory, {512})
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps we then also want to express match cost in a memory-centric way, instead of the usual cpu-centric way:</p>

<pre><code>SlotWeight = floor(Memory / 512)
</code></pre>

<p>Here it is worth noting that in this implementation of negotiator-side consumption, the cost of a match is defined as W(S) - W(S&#8217;), where W(S) is the weight of the slot <em>prior</em> to consuming resources from the match and consumption policy, and W(S`) is the weight evaluated for the slot <em>after</em> those resources are subtracted.  This modification enables multiple matches to be made against a single p-slot, and furthermore it paves the way to possible avenues for a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/26/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-computing-claim-capacity-from-consumption-policy/">better unit analysis of slot weights and accounting groups</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing the example, if we re-run the example with this new consumption policy, we should see that memory limits reduce the number of jobs matched against <code>slot1</code> to 3:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-'  -e 'matched'
12/03/12 12:58:22 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 12:58:37 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
</code></pre>

<p>Examining the slot memory assets, we see that there is insufficient memory for a fourth match when our consumption policy sets the minimum at 512:</p>

<pre><code>$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotMemory
slot1@rorschach | 1903
slot1_1@rorschach | 512
slot1_2@rorschach | 512
slot1_3@rorschach | 512
</code></pre>

<p>As a final example, I&#8217;ll demonstrate the positive impact of negotiator side matching on interactions with accounting groups (or submitter shares).  Again returning to my original example, modify the configuration with a simple accounting group policy:</p>

<pre><code>GROUP_NAMES = a
GROUP_QUOTA_a = 1
GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS = False
GROUP_AUTOREGROUP = False
</code></pre>

<p>Now submit 2 jobs against accounting group <code>a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = 60
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
+AccountingGroup="a.u"
queue 2
</code></pre>

<p>We see that accounting groups are respected: one job runs, and it does not suffer from insufficient share to acquire resources from <code>slot1</code> <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">(GT3013)</a>, because match cost is computed using only the individual job&#8217;s impact on slot weight, instead of being required to match the entire p-slot:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f ~/condor/local/log/NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-' -e matched
12/03/12 14:57:50 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 14:58:08 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In two previous posts, I made a case to motivate the need for a better definition of slot weights and group quotas that could accommodate use cases involving aggregate resources (partitionable slots) with heterogeneous consumption policies and also provide a principled unit analysis for weights and quotas.  These previous posts can be viewed here:</p>

</ul>


<p>As previously mentioned, a Claim Capacity Model of accounting group quotas and slot weights (or &#8220;resource consumption costs&#8221;) requires a resource claiming model that assigns a well defined finite value for the maximum number of claims that each resource and its consumption policy can support.  It must also be re-evaluatable on a resource as its assets are consumed, so that the cost of a proposed claim (or match, in negotiation-speak) can be defined as W(R) - W(R&#8217;), were R&#8217; embodies the amounts of all assets remaining after the claim has taken its share.  (Here, I will be using the term &#8216;assets&#8217; to refer to quantities such as cpus, memory, disk, swap or any <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/extensible-machine-resources/">extensible resources</a> defined, to clarify the difference between an aggregate resource (i.e. a partitionable slot) versus a single resource dimension such as cpus, memory, etc).</p>

<p>This almost immediately raises the question of how best to define such a resource claiming model.  In this post I will briefly describe a few possible approaches, focusing on models which are easy reason about, easy to configure and additionally allow claim capacity for a resource - W(R) - to be computed automatically for the user, thus making a sane relationship between consumption policies and consumption costs possible to enforce.</p>

<h3>Approach 1: fixed claim consumption model</h3>

<p>The simplest-possible approach is arguably to just directly configure a fixed number, M, of claims attached to a resource.  In this model, each match of a job against a resource consumes one of the M claims.   Here, match cost W(R) - W(R&#8217;) = 1 in all cases, and is independent of the &#8216;size&#8217; of assets consumed from a resource.</p>

<p>A possible use case for such a model is that one might wish to declare that a resource can run up to a certain number of jobs, without assigning any particular cost to consuming individual assets.  If the pool users&#8217; workload consists of large numbers of resource-cheap jobs that can effectively share cpu, memory, etc, then such a model might be a good fit.</p>

<h3>Approach 2: configure asset quantization levels</h3>

<p>Another approach that makes the relation between consumption policy and claim capacity easy to think about is to configure a quantization level for each resource asset.  For example, here we might quantize memory into 20 levels, i.e. Q(memory) = 20.  Similarly we might define Q(cpus) = 10 (note that HTCondor does not currently handle fractional cpus on resources, but this kind of model would benefit if floating point asset fractions were supported).  At any time, a resource R has some number q(a) left of the original Q(a).  A job requests an amount r(a) for asset (a).   Here, a claim gets a quantized approximation of any requested asset = V(a)(n(a)/Q(a)), where V(a) is the total original value available for asset (a), and n(a) = ceiling(r(a)Q(a)/V(a)).   Here there are two possible sub-policies.  If we demand that each claim consume >= 1 quantum of every asset (i.e. n(a) >= 1), then the claim capacity W(R) is the minimum of q(a), for (a) over all assets.  However, if a claim is allowed to consume a zero quantity of some individual assets (n(a)=0), then the claim capacity is the <em>maximum</em> of the q(a).   In this case, one must address the corner case of a claim attempting to consume (n(a)=0) over all assets.  The resulting resource R&#8217; has q&#8217;(a) = q(a)-n(a), and W(R&#8217;) is the minium (or maximum) over the new q&#8217;(a).</p>

<h3>Approach 3: configure minimum asset charges</h3>

<p>A third approach is to configure a <em>minimum</em> amount of each asset that any claim must be charged.   For example, we might define a minimum amount of memory C(memory) to charge any claim.   If a job requests an amount r(a), it will always receive max(r(a), C(a)).  As above, q(a) is the number of quanta currently available for asset (a).  Let v(a) be the amount of (a) currently available.  Here we define q(a) for an asset (a) to be floor(v(a)/C(a)).   If we adhere to a reasonable restriction that C(a) must be strictly > 0 for all (a), we are guaranteed a well defined W(R) = min over the q(a).</p>

<p>It is an open question which of these models (or some other completely different options) should be supported.  Conceivably all of them could be provided as options.</p>

<p>Currently my personal preference leans toward Approach 3.  It is easy to reason about and configure.  It yields a well defined W(R) in all circumstances, with no corner cases, that is straightforward to compute and enforce automatically.  It is easy to configure heterogeneous consumption policies that cost different resource assets in different ways, simply by tuning minimum charge C(a) appropriately for each asset.  This includes claim capacity models where jobs are assumed to use very small amounts of any resource, including fractional shares of cpu assets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my previous post about <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/13/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-for-heterogeneous-and-multidimensional-compute-resources">Rethinking the Semantics of Group Quotas and Slot Weights</a>, I proposed a concept for unifying the semantics of accounting group quotas and slot weights across arbitrary resource allocation strategies.</p>

<p>My initial terminology was that the weight of a slot (i.e. resource ad) is a measure of the <em>maximum</em> number of jobs that might match against that ad, given the currently available resource quantities and the allocation policy.  The cost of a match becomes the amount by which that measure is reduced, after the match&#8217;s resources are removed from the ad.</p>

<p>In the HTCondor vocabulary, a job acquires a <em>claim</em> on resources to actually run after it has been matched.  It has been proposed that it may be beneficial for HTCondor to evolve toward a model where there are (aggregate) resource ads, and claims against those ads, as a simplification of the current model which involves static, partitionable and dynamic slots, with claims.  With this in mind, a preferable terminology for group quota and weight semantics might be that a resource ad (or slot) has a measure of the maximum number of claims it could dispense: a <em>claim capacity</em> measure.  The cost of a claim (or match) is the corresponding reduction of the resource&#8217;s claim capacity.</p>

<p>So, this semantic model could be referred to as the Claim Capacity Model of group quotas and slot weights.  With this terminology, the shared &#8216;unit&#8217; for group quotas and slot weights would be <em>claims</em> instead of <em>jobs</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The HTCondor semantic for accounting group quotas and slot weights is currently cpu-centric.  This is an artifact of the historic primacy of cpu as the most commonly-considered limiting resource in computations.  For example the <code>SlotWeight</code> attribute is currently defaulted to <code>Cpus</code>, and when slot weights are disabled, there is logic activated in matchmaking to sum the available cpus on slots to avoid &#8216;undercounting&#8217; total pool quotas.</p>

<p>However, HTCondor slots &#8211; the core model of computational resources in an HTCondor pool &#8211; manage four resources by default: cpu, memory, disk and swap.  Furthermore, slots may now be configured with arbitrary custom resources.  As recently mentioned by <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/no-longer-thinking-in-slots-thinking-in-aggregate-resources-and-consumption-policies">Matthew Farrellee</a>, there is a growing pressure to provide robust support not just for traditional cpu-centric resource presentation, usage and allocation, but also seamlessly mediated with memory-centric, gpu-centric or &#8216;*&#8217;-centric resource allocation policies and more generally allocation policies that are simultaneously aware of all resource dimensions.</p>

<p>This goal immediately raises some questions for the semantics of accounting groups and slot weights when matching jobs against slots during matchmaking.</p>

<p>Consider a pool where 50% of the slots are &#8216;weighted&#8217; in a traditional cpu-centric way, but the other 50% are intended to be allocated in a memory-centric way.  This is currently possible, as the <code>SlotWeight</code> attribute can be configured appropriately to be a function of either <code>Cpus</code> or <code>Memory</code>.</p>

<p>But in a scenario where slots are weighted as functions of heterogeneous resource dimensions, it raises a semantic question:  when we sum these weights to obtain the pool-wide available quota, what &#8216;real world&#8217; quantity does this total represent &#8211; if any?   Is it a purely heuristic numeric value with no well defined unit attached?</p>

<p>This question has import.  Understanding what the answer is, or should be, impacts what story we tell to users about what their accounting group configuration actually means.  When I assign a quota to an accounting group in such a heterogeneous environment, what is that quota regulating?   When a job matches a cpu-centric slot, does the cost of that match have a different meaning than when matching against a memory-centric slot?   When the slots are partitionable, a match implies a certain multi-dimensional slice of resources allocated from that slot.  What is the cost of that slice?  Does the sum of costs add up to the original weight on the partitionable slot?  If not, how does that affect our understanding of quota semantics?</p>

<p>It may be possible unify all of these ideas by adopting the perspective that a slot&#8217;s weight is a measure of the maximum number of jobs that can be matched against it.  The cost of a match is W(S)-W(S&#8217;), where W(S) is the weight function evaluated on the slot prior to match, and W(S&#8217;) is the corresponding weight after the match has extracted its requested resources.  The pool&#8217;s total quota is just the sum of W(S), over all slots S in the pool.  Note, this implies that the &#8216;unit&#8217; attached to both slot weights and accounting group quotas is &#8216;jobs&#8217;.</p>

<p>Consider a simple example from the traditional cpu-centric configuration:   A partitionable slot is configured with 8 cpus, and <code>SlotWeight</code> is just its default <code>Cpus</code>.  Using this model, the allocation policy is: &#8216;each match must use >= 1 cpu&#8221;, and that other resource requests are assumed to be not limiting.  The maximum number of matches is 8 jobs, each requesting 1 cpu.   However, a job might also request 2 cpus.  In this case, note that the cost of the match is 2, since the remaining slot has 6 slots, and so W(S&#8217;) now evaluates to 6.   So, the cost of the match is how many fewer possible jobs the original slot can support after the match takes its requested resources.</p>

<p>This approach can be applied equally well to a memory-centric strategy, or a disk centric strategy, or a gpu-based strategy, or any combination simultaneously.  All weights evaluate to a value with unit &#8216;jobs&#8217;.   All match costs are differences between weights (before and after match), and so their values are also in units of &#8216;jobs&#8217;.  Therefore, the semantics of the sum of weights over a pool is always well defined: it is a number of jobs, and spefically a measure of the maximum number of jobs that might match against all the slots in the pool.  When a match acquires resources that reduce this maximum by more than 1 job, that is not in any way inconsistent.  It means the job used resources that might have supported two or more &#8216;smaller&#8217; jobs.   This means that accounting group quotas (and submitter shares) also have a well defined unit and semantic, which is &#8216;how many (or what fraction of) the maximum possible jobs is this group guaranteed by my accounting policy&#8217;</p>

<p>One implication of this proposed semantic for quotas and weights is that the measure for the maximum number of jobs that may match against any given slot must be some finite number.   It implies that all resource dimensions are quantized in some way by the allocation policy.   This scheme would not support a real-valued resource dimension that had no minimum quantization.  I do not think that this is a very heavy-weight requirement, and in fact we have already been moving in that direction with features such as MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS_xxx.</p>

<p>When a slot&#8217;s resource allocation policy is defined over all its resources, what bounds this measure of maximum possible matches?  In a case where each job match <em>must</em> use at least one non-zero quantum of each resource dimension, then the limit is the resource with the mimimum quantized levels.   In a case where jobs may request a zero amount of resources, then the limit is the resource with the maximum quantized levels.  (note, it is required that each match use at least one quantum of at least one resource, otherwise the maximum is not properly bounded).</p>
