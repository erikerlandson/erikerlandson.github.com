  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post I am going to describe some results I obtained for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clustering</a> machines by which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager">RPM packages</a> that were installed on them.  The clustering technique I used was <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#unsup">Random Forest Clustering</a>.</p>

<p><a name="data"></a></p>

<h5>The Data</h5>

<p>The data I clustered consisted of 135 machines, each with a list of installed RPM packages.  The number of unique package names among all 135 machines was 4397.  Each machine was assigned a vector of Boolean values: a value of <code>1</code> indicates that the corresponding RPM was installed on that machine.  This means that the clustering data occupied a space of nearly 4400 dimensions.  I discuss the implications of this <a href="#payoff">later in the post</a>, and what it has to do with Random Forest Clustering in particular.</p>

<p>For ease of navigation and digestion, the remainder of this post is organized in sections:</p>

<h5>Random Forests and Random Forest Clustering</h5>

<p>Full explainations of <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm">Random Forests</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#unsup">Random Forest Clustering</a> could easily occupy blog posts of their own, but I will attempt to summarize them briefly here.  Random Forest learning models <em>per se</em> are well covered in the machine learning community, and available in most machine learning toolkits.  With that in mind, I will focus on their application to Random Forest Clustering, as it is less commonly used.</p>

<p>A Random Forest is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble learning model</a>, consisting of some number of individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision trees</a>, each trained on a random subset of the training data, and which choose from a random subset of candidate features when learning each internal decision node.</p>

<p>Random Forest Clustering begins by training a Random Forest to distinguish between the data to be clustered, and a corresponding <em>synthetic</em> data set created by sampling from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution">marginal</a> distributions of each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector">feature</a>.  If the data has well defined clusters in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution">joint feature space</a> (a common scenario), then the model can identify these clusters as standing out from the more homogeneous distribution of synthetic data.  A simple example of what this looks like in 2 dimensional data is displayed in Figure 1, where the dark red dots are the data to be clustered, and the lighter pink dots represent synthetic data generated from the marginal distributions:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rfc_machines/demo1_both.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Each interior decision node, in each tree of a Random Forest, typically divides the space of feature vectors in half: the half-space &lt;= some threshold, and the half-space > that threshold.  The result is that the model learned for our data can be visualized as rectilinear regions of space.  In this simple example, these regions can be plotted directly over the data, and show that the Random Forest did indeed learn the location of the data clusters against the background of synthetic data:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rfc_machines/demo1_rules.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Once this model has been trained, the actual data to be clustered are evaluated against this model.  Each data element navigates the interior decision nodes and eventually arrives at a leaf-node of each tree in the Random Forest ensemble, as illustrated in the following schematic:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rfc_machines/eval_leafs.png" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>A key insight of Random Forest Clustering is that if two objects (or, their feature vectors) are similar, then they are likely to arrive at the same leaf nodes more often than not.  As the figure above suggests, it means we can cluster objects by their corresponding vectors of leaf nodes, <em>instead</em> of their raw feature vectors.</p>

<p>If we map the points in our toy example to leaf ids in this way, and then cluster the results, we obtain the following two clusters, which correspond well with the structure of the data:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rfc_machines/demo1_clust.png" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>A note on clustering leaf ids.  A leaf id is just that &#8211; an identifier &#8211; and in that respect a vector of leaf ids has no <em>algebra</em>; it is not meaningful to take an average of such identifiers, any more than it would be meaningful to take the average of people&#8217;s names.  Pragmatically, what this means is that the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering algorithm</a> <em>cannot</em> be applied to this problem.</p>

<p>These vectors do, however, have <em>distance</em>: for any pair of vectors, add 1 for each corresponding pair of leaf ids that differ.  If two data elements arrived at all the same leafs in the Random Forest model, all their leaf ids are the same, and their distance is zero (with respect to the model, they are the same).  Therefore, we <em>can</em> apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">k-medoids clustering</a>.</p>

<p><a name="payoff"></a></p>

<h5>The Pay-Off</h5>

<p>What does this somewhat indirect method of clustering buy us?  Why <em>not</em> just cluster objects by their raw feature vectors?</p>

<p>The problem is that in many real-world cases (unlike in our toy example above), feature vectors computed for objects have <em>many dimensions</em> &#8211; hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions &#8211; instead of the two dimensions in this example.  Computing distances on such objects, necessary for clustering, is often expensive, and worse yet the quality of these distances is frequently poor due to the fact that most features in large spaces will be poorly correlated with <em>any</em> structure in the data.  This problem is so common, and so important, it has a name: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">Curse of Dimensionality</a>.</p>

<p>Random Forest Clustering, which clusters on vectors of leaf-node ids from the trees in the model, side-steps the curse of dimensionality because the Random Forest training process, by learning where the data is against the background of the synthetic data, has already identified the features that are useful for identifying the structure of the data!   If any particular feature was poorly correlated with that struture, it has already been ignored by the model.  In other words, a Random Forest Clustering model is implicitly examining <strong> <em>exactly those features that are most useful for clustering</em> </strong>, thus providing a cure for the Curse of Dimensionality.</p>

<p>The <a href="#data">machine package configurations</a> whose clustering I describe for this post are a good example of high dimensional data that is vulnerable to the Curse of Dimensionality.  The dimensionality of the feature space is nearly 4400, making distances between vectors potentially expensive to evaluate.  Any individual feature contributes little to the distance, having to contend with over 4000 other features.  Installed packages are also noisy.  Many packages, such as kernels, are installed everywhere.  Others may be installed but not used, making them potentially irrelevant to grouping machines.  Furthermore, there are only 135 machines, and so there are far more features than data examples, making this an underdetermined data set.</p>

<p>All of these factors make the machine package configuration data a good test of the strenghts of Random Forest Clustering.</p>

<p><a name="code"></a></p>

<h5>Package Configuration Clustering Code</h5>

<p>The implementation of Random Forest Clustering I used for the results in this post is a library available from the <a href="http://silex.freevariable.com/">silex project</a>, a package of analytics libraries and utilities for <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>.</p>

<p>In this section I will describe three code fragments that load the machine configuration data, perform a Random Forest clustering, and format some of the output.  This is the code I ran to obtain the <a href="#results">results</a> described in the final section of this post.</p>

<p>The first fragment of code illustrates the logistics of loading the feature vectors from file <code>train.txt</code> that represent the installed-package configurations for each machine. A corresponding &#8220;parallel&#8221; file <code>nodesclean.txt</code> contains corresponding machine names for each vector.  A third companion file <code>rpms.txt</code> contains names of each installed package.  These are used to instantiate a specialized Scala function (<code>InvertibleIndexFunction</code>) between feature indexes and human-readable feature names (in this case, names of RPM packages).  Finally, another specialized function (<code>Extractor</code>) for instantiating Spark feature vectors is created.</p>

<p>Note: <code>Extractor</code> and <code>InvertibleIndexFunction</code> are also component libraries of <a href="http://silex.freevariable.com/">silex</a></p>

<p>The next section of code is where the work of Random Forest Clustering happens.  A <code>RandomForestCluster</code> object is instantiated, and configured.  Here, the configuration is for 7 clusters, 250 synthetic points (about twice as many synthetic points as true data), and a Random Forest of 20 trees.  Training against the input data is a simple call to the <code>run</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>predictWithDistanceBy</code> method is then applied to the data paired with machine names, to yield tuples of cluster-id, distance to cluster center, and the associated machine name.  These tuples are split by distance into data with a cluster, and data considered to be &#8220;outliers&#8221; (i.e. elements far from any cluster center).  Lastly, the <code>histFeatures</code> method is applied, to examine the Random Forest Model and identify any commonly-used features.</p>

<h5>Package Configuration Clustering Results</h5>

<p>The result of running the code in the <a href="#code">previous section</a> is seven clusters of machines.  In the following files, the first column represents distance from the cluster center, and the second is the actual machine&#8217;s node name.  A cluster distance of 0.0 indicates that the machine was indistinguishable from cluster center, as far as the Random Forest model was concerned.   The larger the distance, the more different from the cluster&#8217;s center a machine was, in terms of its installed RPM packages.</p>

<p>Was the clustering meaningful?  Examining the first two clusters below is promising; the machine names in these clusters are clearly similar, likely configured for some common task by the IT department.  The first cluster of machines appears to be web servers and corresponding backend services.  It would be unsurprising to find their RPM configurations were similar.</p>

<p>The second cluster is a series of executor machines of varying sizes, but presumably these would be configured similarly to one another.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_2"></script>


<p>The second pair of clusters (3 &amp; 4) are small.  All of their names are similar (and furthermore, similar to some machines in other clusters), and so an IT administrator might wonder why they ended up in oddball small clusters.  Perhaps they have some spurious, non-standard packages installed that ought to be cleaned up.  Identifying these kinds of structure in a clustering is one common clustering application.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_3"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_4"></script>


<p>Cluster 5 is a series of bugzilla web servers and corresponding back-end bugzilla data base services.  Although they were clustered together, we see that the web servers have a larger distance from the center, indicating a somewhat different configuration.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_5"></script>


<p>Cluster 6 represents a group of performance-related machines.  Not all of these machines occupy the same distance, even though most of their names are similar.  These are also the same series of machines as in clusters 3 &amp; 4.  Does this indicate spurious package installations, or some other legitimate configuration difference?  A question for the IT department&#8230;</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_6"></script>


<p>Cluster 7 is by far the largest.  It is primarily a combination of OpenStack machines and yet more perf machines.   This clustering was relatively stable &#8211; it appeared across multiple independent clustering runs.  Because of its stability I would suggest to an IT administrator that the performance and OpenStack machines are sharing some configuration similarities, and the performance machines in other clusters suggest that there might be yet more configuration anomalies.  Perhaps these were OpenStack nodes that were re-purposed as performance machines?  Yet another question for IT&#8230;</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_7"></script>


<p><a name="outliers"></a></p>

<h5>Outliers</h5>

<p>This last grouping represents machines which were &#8220;far&#8221; from any of the previous cluster centers.  They may be interpreted as &#8220;outliers&#8221; - machines that don&#8217;t fit any model category.  Of these the node <code>frodo</code> is clearly somebody&#8217;s personal machine, likely with a customized or idiosyncratic package configuration.  Unsurprising that it is farthest of all machines from any cluster, with distance 9.0.   The <code>jenkins</code> machine is also somewhat unique among the nodes, and so perhaps not surprising that its registers as anomalous.  The remaining machines match node series from other clusters.   Their large distance is another indication of spurious configurations for IT to examine.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=outliers"></script>


<p>I will conclude with another useful feature of Random Forest Models, which is that you can interrogate them for information such as which features were used most frequently.  Here is a histogram of model features (in this case, installed packages) that were used most frequently in the clustering model.  This particular histogram i sinteresting, as no feature was used more than twice.  The remaining features were all used exactly once.  This is a bit unusual for a Random Forest model.  Frequently some features are used commonly, with a longer tail.  This histogram is rather &#8220;flat,&#8221; which may be a consequence of there being many more features (over 4000 installed packages) than there are data elements (135 machines).  This makes the problem somewhat under-determined.  To its credit, the model still achieves a meaningful clustering.</p>

<p>Lastly I&#8217;ll note that full histogram length was 186; in other words, of the nearly 4400 installed packages, the Random Forest model used only 186 of them &#8211; a tiny fraction!  A nice illustration of Random Forest Clustering performing in the face of <a href="#payoff">high dimensionality</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Suppose I have a collection of (N) objects, and distances d(j,k) between each pair of objects (j) and (k); that is, my objects are members of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space">metric space</a>.  I have no knowledge about my objects, beyond these pair-wise distances.  These objects could be construed as vertices in an (N-1) dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">simplex</a>.  However, since I have no spatial information about my objects, I first need a way to assign spatial locations to each object, in vector space R<sup>(N-1),</sup> with only my object distances to work with.</p>

<p>In this post I will derive an algorithm for assigning vertex locations in R<sup>(N-1)</sup> for each of N objects, using only pairwise object distances.</p>

<p>I will assume that N >= 2, since at least two object are required to define a pairwise distance.  The case N=2 is easy, as I can assign vertex 1 to the origin, and vertex 2 to the point d(1,2), to form a 1-simplex (i.e. a line segment) whose single edge is just the distance between the two objects.  I will also assume that my N objects are distinct; that is, each pair has a non-zero distance.</p>

<p>Next consider an arbitrary N, and suppose I have already added vertices 1 through k.  The next vertex (k+1) must obey the pairwise distance relations, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/jm56vxq.png" alt="figure 1" /></p>

<p>Adding the new vertex (k+1) involves adding another dimension (k) to the simplex.  I define this new kth coordinate x(k) to be zero for the existing k vertices, as annotated above; only the new vertex (k+1) will have a non-zero kth coordinate.  Expanding the quadratic terms on the left yields the following form:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/jtm7dpq.png" alt="figure 2" /></p>

<p>The squared terms for the coordinates of the new vertex (k+1) are inconvenient, however I can get rid of them by subtracting pairs of equations above.  For example, if I subtract equation 1 from the remaining k-1 equations (2 through k), these squared terms disappear, leaving me with the following system of k-1 equations, which we can see is linear in the 1st k-1 coordinates of the new vertex.  Therefore, I know I&#8217;ll be able to solve for those coordinates.  I can solve for the remaining kth coordinate by plugging it into the first distance equation:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/haovm32.png" alt="figure 3" /></p>

<p>To clarify matters, the equations above can be re-written as the following matrix equation, solveable by any linear systems library:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/h6qdtms.png" alt="figure 4" /></p>

<p>This gives me a recusion relation for adding a new vertex (k+1), given that I have already added the first k vertices.  The basis case of adding the first two vertices was already described above.  And so I can iteratively add all my vertices one at a time by applying the recursion relation.</p>

<p>As a corollary, assume that I have constructed a simplex having k vertices, as shown above, and I would like to assign a spatial location to a new object, (y), given its k distances to each vertex.  The corresponding distance relations are given by:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/zdw9uv8.png" alt="figure 5" /></p>

<p>I can apply a derivation very similar to the one above, to obtain the following linear equation for the (k-1) coordinates of (y):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post I&#8217;m going to propose a new abstract operation on <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds">Spark RDDs</a> &#8211; <strong>multiplexing</strong> &#8211; that makes some categories of operations on RDDs both easier to program and in many cases much faster.</p>

<p>My main working example will be the operation of splitting a collection of data elements into N randomly-selected subsamples.  This operation is quite common in machine learning, for the purpose of dividing data into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set">training and testing set</a>, or the related task of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics">creating folds for cross-validation</a>).</p>

<p>Consider the current standard RDD method for accomplishing this task, <code>randomSplit()</code>.  This method takes a collection of N weights, and returns N output RDDs, each of which contains a randomly-sampled subset of the input, proportional to the corresponding weight.  The <code>randomSplit()</code> method generates the jth output by running a random number generator (RNG) for each input data element and accepting all elements which are in the corresponding jth (normalized) weight range.  As a diagram, the process looks like this at each RDD partition:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/mux/randomsplit.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>The observation I want to draw attention to is that to produce the N output RDDs, it has to run a random sampling over every element in the input <em>for each output</em>.  So if you are splitting into 10 outputs (e.g. for a 10-fold cross-validation), you are re-sampling your input 10 times, the only difference being that each output is created using a different acceptance range for the RNG output.</p>

<p>To see what this looks like in code, consider a simplified version of random splitting that just takes an integer <code>n</code> and always produces (n) equally-weighted outputs:</p>

<p>(Note that for this method to operate correctly, the RNG seed must be set to the same value each time, or the data will not be correctly partitioned)</p>

<p>While this approach to random splitting works fine, resampling the same data N times is somewhat wasteful.  However, it is possible to re-organize the computation so that the input data is sampled only once.  The idea is to run the RNG once per data element, and save the element into a randomly-chosen collection.  To make this work in the RDD compute model, all N output collections reside in a single row of an <em>intermediate</em> RDD &#8211; a &#8220;manifold&#8221; RDD.  Each output RDD then takes its data from the corresponding collection in the manifold RDD, as in this diagram:</p>

<p>Here, the operation of sampling is generalized to any user-supplied function that maps RDD partition data into a sequence of objects that are computed in a single pass, and then multiplexed to the final user-visible outputs.  Note that these functions take a <code>StorageLevel</code> argument that can be used to control the caching level of the internal &#8220;manifold&#8221; RDD.  This typically defaults to <code>MEMORY_ONLY</code>, so that the computation can be saved and re-used for efficiency.</p>

<p>An efficient split-sampling method based on multiplexing, as described above, might be written using <code>flatMuxPartitions</code> as follows:</p>

<p>To test whether multiplexed RDDs actually improve compute efficiency, I collected run-time data at various split values of <code>n</code> (from 1 to 10), for both the non-multiplexing logic (equivalent to the standard <code>randomSplit</code>) and the multiplexed version:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/mux/benchmark.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>As the timing data above show, the computation required to run a non-multiplexed version grows linearly with <code>n</code>, just as predicted.  The multiplexed version, by computing the (n) outputs in a single pass, takes a nearly constant amount of time regardless of how many samples the input is split into.</p>

<p>There are other potential applications for multiplexed RDDs.  Consider the following tuple-based versions of multiplexing:</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to run an input-validation filter on some data, sending the data that pass validation into one RDD, and data that failed into a second RDD, paired with information about the error that occurred.  Data validation is a potentially expensive operation.  With multiplexing, you can easily write the filter to operate in a single efficient pass to obtain both the valid stream and the stream of error-data:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to make an argument that the Algebird <a href="http://twitter.github.io/algebird/#com.twitter.algebird.Aggregator">Aggregator</a> design, in particular its use of the <code>prepare</code> operation in a map-reduce context, has substantial inefficiencies, compared to an equivalent formulation that is more directly suited to taking advantage of Scala&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Seq">aggregate method on collections</a> method.</p>

<p>Consider the definition of aggregation in the Aggregator class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scala'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">apply</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">inputs</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">TraversableOnce</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">])</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">C</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">present</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">reduce</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">inputs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">prepare</span><span class="o">)))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can see that it is a standard map/reduce operation, where <code>reduce</code> is defined as a monoidal (or semigroup &#8211; more on this later) operation. Under the hood, it boils down to an invocation of Scala&#8217;s <code>reduceLeft</code> method.  The key thing to notice is that the role of <code>prepare</code> is to map a collection of data elements into the required monoids, which are then aggregated using that monoid&#8217;s <code>plus</code> operation.  In other words, <code>prepare</code> converts data elements into &#8220;singleton&#8221; monoids each representing a data element.</p>

<p>Now, if the monoid in question is simple, say some numeric type, this conversion is free, or nearly so.  For example, the conversion of an integer into the &#8220;integer monoid&#8221; is a no-op.  However, there are other kinds of &#8220;non-trivial&#8221; monoids, for which the conversion of a data element into its corresponding monoid may be costly.  In this post, I will be using the monoid defined by Scala Set[Int], where the monoid <code>plus</code> operation is set union, and of course the <code>zero</code> element is the empty set.</p>

<p>Consider the process of defining an Algebird aggregator for the task of generating the set of unique elements in a data set.  The corresponding <code>prepare</code> operation is: <code>prepare(e: Int) = Set(e)</code>.  A monoid trait that encodes this idea might look like the following.  (the code I used in this post can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/d96dc553bc51e0eb5e4b">here</a>)</p>

<p>If we unpack the above code, as applied to <code>intSetPrepared</code>, we are instantiating a new Set object, containing a single value, for every single input data element.</p>

<p>But there is a potentially better model of aggregation, exemplified by the Scala <code>aggregate</code> method.  This method does not use a <code>prepare</code> operation.  It uses a zero value and a monoidal operator, which the Scala docs refer to as <code>combop</code>, but it also uses an &#8220;update&#8221; operation, that defines how to update the monoid object, directly, with a single element, referred to as <code>seqop</code> in Scala&#8217;s documentation.  This idea can also be encoded as a flavor of monoid, enhanced with an <code>update</code> method:</p>

<p>Readers familiar with Algebird may be wondering about my use of monoids above, when the <code>Aggregator</code> interface is actually based on semigroups.  This is important, since building on Scala&#8217;s <code>aggregate</code> function requires a zero element that semigroups do not have.  Although I believe it might be worth considering changing <code>Aggregator</code> to use monoids, another sensible option is to change the internal logic for the subclass <code>AggregatorMonoid</code>, which does require a monoid, or possibly just define a new <code>AggregatorMonoidUpdated</code> subclass.</p>

<p>A final note on compatability: note that any monoid enhanced with <code>prepare</code> can be converted into an equivalent monoid enhanced with <code>update</code>, as demonstrated by this factory function:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post I will demonstrate how to do reservoir sampling orders of magnitude faster than the traditional &#8220;naive&#8221; reservoir sampling algorithm, using a fast high-fidelity approximation to the reservoir sampling-gap distribution.</p>

<blockquote><p>The code I used to collect the data for this post can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/reservoir/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/sample/reservoir/reservoir.scala">here</a>.  I generated the plots using the <a href="https://github.com/quantifind/wisp">quantifind WISP</a> project.</p>

<p>Update (April 4, 2016): my colleague <a href="http://rnowling.github.io/">RJ Nowling</a> ran across a <a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit87.RandomSampling.pdf">paper by J.S. Vitter</a> that shows Vitter developed the trick of accelerating sampling with a sampling-gap distribution in 1987 &#8211; I re-invented Vitter&#8217;s wheel 30 years after the fact!  I&#8217;m surprised it never caught on, as it is not much harder to implement than the naive version.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> for the corresponding sampling distributions.  More recently, I also began exploring whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">reservoir sampling</a> might also be optimized using the gap sampling technique, by deriving the <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">reservoir sampling gap distribution</a>.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it presupposes that you can actually draw values from that distribution substantially faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.  I was unable to come up with a &#8220;direct&#8221; algorithm for drawing samples from P(k) above (I suspect none exists), however I also know the CDF F(k), so it <em>is</em> possible to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inversion sampling</a>, which runs in logarithmic time w.r.t the desired accuracy.  Although its logarithmic cost effectively guarantees that it will be a net efficiency win for sufficiently large (j), it still involves a substantial number of computations to yield its samples, and it seems unlikely to be competitive with straight &#8220;naive&#8221; reservoir sampling over many real-world data sizes, where (j) may never grow very large.</p>

<p>Well, if exact computations are too expensive, we can always look for a fast approximation.  Consider the original &#8220;first principles&#8221; formula for the sampling gap P(k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>As the figure above alludes to, if (j) is relatively large compared to (k), then values (j+1),(j+2)&#8230;(j+k) are all going to be effectively &#8220;close&#8221; to (j), and so we can replace them all with (j) as an approximation.  Note that the resulting approximation is just the PMF of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a>, with probability of success p=(R/j), and we already saw how to efficiently draw values from a geometric distribution from our experience with Bernoulli sampling.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to hope that this approximation will be useful?  For reasons that are similar to those for Bernoulli gap sampling, it will only be efficient to employ gap sampling when the probability (R/j) becomes small enough.  From our experiences with Bernoulli sampling that is <em>at least</em> j>=2R.  So, we have some assurance that (j) itself will be never be <em>very</em> small.  What about (k)?  Note that a geometric distribution &#8220;favors&#8221; smaller values of (k) &#8211; that is, small values of (k) have the highest probabilities.  In fact, the smaller that (j) is, the larger the probability (R/j) is, and so the more likely that (k) values that are small relative to (j) will be the frequent ones.  It is also promising that the true distribution for P(k) <em>also</em> favors smaller values of (k) (in fact it favors them even a bit more strongly than the approximation).</p>

<p>Although it is encouraging, it is also clear that my argument above is limited to heuristic hand-waving.  What does this approximation really <em>look</em> like, compared to the true distribution?  Fortunately, it is easy to plot both distributions numerically, since we now know the formulas for both:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/CDFs_R=10.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>The plot above shows that, in fact, the geometric approximation is a <em>surprisingly good</em> approximation to the true distribution!  Furthermore, the approximation remains good as both (j) and (k) grow larger.</p>

<p>Our numeric eye-balling looks quite promising.  Is there an effective way to <em>measure</em> how good this approximation is?  One useful measure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic</a>, which is just the maximum absolute error between two cumulative distributions.  Here is a plot of the D statistic for reservoir size R=10, as (j) varies across several magnitudes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=10.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This plot is also good news: we can see that deviation, as measured by D, remains bounded at a small value (less than 0.0262).  As this is for the specific value R=10, we also want to know how things change as reservoir size changes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=all.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p>The news is still good!  As reservoir size grows, the approximation only gets better: the D values get smaller as R increases, and remain asymptotically bounded as (j) increases.</p>

<p>Now we have some numeric assurance that the geometric approximation is a good one, and stays good as reservoir size grows and sampling runs get longer.  However, we should also verify that an actual implementation of the approximation works as expected.</p>

<p>Here is pseudocode for an implementation of reservoir sampling using the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<pre><code>// data is array to sample from
// R is the reservoir size
function reservoirFast(data: Array, R: Int) {
  n = data.length
  // Initialize reservoir with first R elements of data:
  res = data[0 until R]
  // Until this threshold, use traditional sampling.  This value may
  // depend on performance characteristics of random number generation and/or
  // numeric libraries:
  t = 4 * R
  j = 1 + R
  while (j &lt; n  &amp;&amp;  j &lt;= t) {
    k = randomInt(j) // random integer &gt;= 0 and &lt; j
    if (k &lt; R) res[k] = data[j]
    j = j + 1
  }
  // Once gaps become significant, it pays to do gap sampling
  while (j &lt; n) {
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = R/j
    p = R / j
    u = randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1
    g = floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    j = j + g
    if (j &lt; n) {
      k = randomInt(R)
      res[k] = data[j]
    }
    j = j + 1
  }
  // return the reservoir
  return res
}
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a plot that shows two-sample D statistics, comparing the distribution in sample gaps between runs of the exact &#8220;naive&#8221; reservoir sampling with the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/D_naive_vs_fast.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>As expected, the measured difference in sampling characteristics between naive and fast approximation are small, confirming the numeric predictions.</p>

<p>Since the point of this exercise was to achieve faster random sampling, it remains to measure what kind of speed improvements the fast approximation provides.  As a point of reference, here is a plot of run times for reservoir sampling over 10<sup>8</sup> integers:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/naive_sample_time_vs_R.png" title="Figure 7" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<p>As expected, sample time remains constant at around 1.5 seconds, regardless of reservoir size, since the naive algorithm always samples from its RNG per each sample.</p>

<p>Compare this to the corresponding plot for the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sample_times_vs_R.png" title="Figure 8" alt="Figure 8" /></p>

<p>Firstly, we see that the sampling times are <em>much faster</em>, as originally anticipated in my <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">previous post</a> &#8211; in the neighborhood of 3 orders of magnitude faster.  Secondly, we see that the sampling times do increase as a linear function of reservoir size.  Based on our experience with Bernoulli gap sampling, this is expected; the sampling probabilities are given by (R/j), and therefore the amount of sampling is proportional to R.</p>

<p>Another property anticipated in my previous post was that the efficiency of gap sampling should continue to increase as the amount of data sampled grows; the sampling probability being (R/j), the probability of sampling decreases as j gets larger, and so the corresponding gap sizes grow.  The following plot verifies this property, holding reservoir size R constant, and increasing the data size:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sampling_efficiency.png" title="Figure 9" alt="Figure 9" /></p>

<p>The sampling time (per million elements) decreases as the sample size grows, as predicted by the formula.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have demonstrated that a geometric distribution can be used as a high quality approximation to the true sampling gap distribution for reservoir sampling, which allows reservoir sampling to be performed much faster than the naive algorithm while still retaining sampling quality.</p>

<h5>A Motivating Use Case</h5>

<p>The skeptical programmer may be wondering what the point of Yet Another Map Collection really is, much less an entire class hierarchy.  The use case that inspired this work was <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird/pull/495">my project</a> of implementing the <a href="https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf">t-digest algorithm</a>.  Discussion of t-digest is beyond the scope of this post, but suffice it to say that constructing a t-digest requires the maintenance of a collection of &#8220;cluster&#8221; objects, that needs to satisfy the following several properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>an entry contains one <strong>or more</strong> cluster objects at a given numeric location</li>
<li>entries are maintained in a numeric key order</li>
<li>entries will be frequently inserted and deleted, in arbitrary order</li>
<li>given a numeric key value, be able to find the entry nearest to that value</li>
<li>given a key, compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum">prefix-sum</a> for that value</li>
<li>all of the above should be bounded by logarithmic time complexity</li>
</ol>


<p>Propreties 2,3 and 6 are commonly satisfied by a map structure backed by some variety of balanced tree representation, of which the best-known is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-Black tree</a>.</p>

<p>Properties 1, 4 and 5 are more interesting.  Property 1 &#8211; representing a collection of multiple objects at each entry &#8211; can be accomplished in a generalizable way by noting that a collection is representable as a monoid, and so supporting values that can be incremented with respect to a <a href="http://twitter.github.io/algebird/index.html#com.twitter.algebird.Monoid">user-supplied monoid relation</a> can satisfy property-1, but also can support many other kinds of update, including but not limited to classical numeric incrementing operations.</p>

<p>Properties 4 and 5 &#8211; nearest-entry queries and prefix-sum queries &#8211; are also both supportable in logarithmic time using a tree data structure, provided that tree is balanced.  Again, the details of the algorithms are out of the current scope, however they are not extremely complex, and their implementations are available in the code.</p>

<p>A reader with their software engineering hat on will notice that these properties are <em>orthogonal</em>.  A programmer might be interested in a data structure supporting any one of them, or in some mixed combination.   This kind of situation fairly shouts &#8220;Scala traits&#8221; (or, alternatively, interfaces in Java, etc).  With that idea in mind, I designed a system of Scala collection traits that support all of the above properties, in a pure trait form that is fully &#8220;mixable&#8221; by the programmer, so that one can use exactly the properties needed, but not pay for anything else.</p>

<p><a name="overview"></a></p>

<h5>Library Overview</h5>

<p>The library consists broadly of 3 kinds of traits:</p>

<ul>
<li>tree node traits &#8211; implement core tree support for some functionality</li>
<li>collection traits &#8211; provide additional collection API methods the user</li>
<li>collections &#8211; instantiate a usable incarnation of a collection</li>
</ul>


<p>For the programmer who wishes to either create a trait mixture, or add new mixable traits, the collections also function as reference implementations.</p>

<p>The three tables that follow summarize the currently available traits of each kind listed above.  They are (at the time of this posting) all under the package namespace <code>com.redhat.et.silex.maps</code>:</p>

<h5>A Red/Black Tree Base Class</h5>

<p>The most fundamental trait in this hierarchy is the trait that embodies Red-Black balancing; a &#8220;red-black-ness&#8221; trait, as it were.  This trait supplies the axiomatic tree operations of insertion, deletion and key lookup, where the Red-Black balancing operations are encapsulated for insertion (due to <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=44273">Chris Okasaki</a>) and deletion (due to <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/smk/redblack/rb.html">Stefan Kahrs</a>)  Note that Red-Black trees do not assume a separate value, as in a map, but require only keys (thus implementing an ordered set over the key type):</p>

<p>I will assume most readers are familiar with basic binary tree operations, and the Red-Black rules are described elsewhere (I adapted them from the Scala red-black implementation).  For the purposes of this discussion, the most interesting feature is that this is a <em>pure Scala trait</em>.  All <code>val</code> declarations are abstract.  This trait, by itself, cannot function without a subclass to eventually perform dependency injection.   However, this abstraction allows the trait to be inherited freely &#8211; any programmer can inherit from this trait and get a basic Red-Black balanced tree for (nearly) free, as long as a few basic principles are adhered to for proper dependency injection.</p>

<p>Another detail to call out is the abstraction of the usual <code>key</code> with a <code>Data</code> element.  This element represents any node payload that is moved around as a unit during tree structure manipulations, such as balancing pivots.  In the case of a map-like subclass, <code>Data</code> is extended to include a <code>value</code> field as well as a <code>key</code> field.</p>

<p>The other noteworthy detail is the abstract definition <code>def iNode(color: Color, d: Data[K], lsub: Node[K], rsub: Node[K]): INode[K]</code> - this is the function called to create any new tree node.  In fact, this function, when eventually instantiated, is what performs dependency injection of other tree node fields.</p>

<h5>Node Inheritance Example: NodeMap[K,V]</h5>

<p>A relatively simple example of node inheritance is hopefully instructive.  Here is the definition for tree nodes supporting a key/value map:</p>

<p>Note that in this case very little is added to the red/black functionality already provided by <code>Node[K]</code>.  A <code>DataMap[K,V]</code> trait is defined to add a <code>value</code> field in addition to the <code>key</code>, and the internal node <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> refines the type of its <code>data</code> field to be <code>DataMap[K,V]</code>.  The semantics is little more than &#8220;tree nodes now carry a value in addition to a key.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tree node trait inherits from its own parent class <em>and</em> the corresponding traits for any mixed-in functionality.  So for example <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> inherits from <code>NodeMap[K,V]</code> but also <code>INode[K]</code>.</p>

<p>You can see that this trait supplies collection API methods that a Scala programmer will recognize as being standard for any map-like collection.  Note that this trait also inherits other standard methods from <code>OrderedLike[K,IN,M]</code> (common to both sets and maps) and <em>also</em> inherits from <code>NodeMap[K,V]</code>: In other words, a collection is effectively yet another kind of tree node, with additional collection API methods mixed in.   Note also the use of &#8220;self types&#8221; (the type parameter <code>M</code>), which allows the collection to return objects of its own kind.  This is crucial for allowing operations like data insertion to return an object that also supports node insertion, and to maintain consistency of type across operations.  The collection type is properly &#8220;closed&#8221; with respect to its own operations.</p>

<p>You can see that (aside from a convenience override of <code>toString</code>) the trait <code>OrderedMap[K,V]</code> is nothing more than a vehicle for instantiating a particular concrete <code>OrderedMapLike[K,V,IN,M]</code> subtype, with particular concrete types for internal node (<code>INodeMap[K,V]</code>) and its own self-type.</p>

<p>Note that the object returned by the factory method is upcast to <code>OrderedMap[K,V]</code>, but in fact has the more complicated type: <code>InjectMap[K,V] with LNodeMap[K,V] with OrderedMap[K,V]</code>.  There are a couple things going on here.  The trait <code>LNodeMap[K,V]</code> ensures that the new object is in particular a leaf node, which embodies a new empty tree in the Red-Black tree system.</p>

<p>The type <code>InjectMap[K,V]</code> has an even more interesting purpose.  Here is its definition:</p>

<p>Firstly, note that it is a bona fide <em>class</em>, as opposed to a trait.  This class is where, finally, all things abstract are made real &#8211; &#8220;dependency injection&#8221; in the parlance of Scala idioms.  You can see that it defines the implementation of abstract method <code>iNode</code>, and that it does this by returning yet <em>another</em> <code>InjectMap[K,V]</code> object, mixed with both <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> and <code>OrderedMap[K,V]</code>, thus maintaining closure with respect to all three slices of functionality: dependency injection, the proper type of internal node, and map collection methods.</p>

<p>The various abstract <code>val</code> fields <code>color</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>lsub</code> and <code>rsub</code> are all given concrete values inside of <code>iNode</code>.  Here is where the value of concrete &#8220;reference&#8221; implementations manifests.  Any fields in the relevant internal-node type must be instantiated here, and the logic of instantiation cannot be inherited while still preserving the ability to mix abstract traits.  Therefore, any programmer wishing to create a new concrete sub-class must replicate the logic for instantiating all inherited in an internal node.</p>

<p>Another example makes the implications more clear.  Here is the definition of injection for a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/rbtraits/src/test/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/maps/mixed.scala">collection that mixes in all three traits</a> for incrementable values, nearest-key queries, and prefix-sum queries:</p>

<p>Here you can see that all logic for both &#8220;basic&#8221; internal nodes and also for maintaining prefix sums, and key min/max information for nearest-entry queries, must be supplied.  If there is a singularity in this design here is where it is.  The saving grace is that it is localized into a single well defined place, and any logic can be transcribed from a proper reference implementation of whatever traits are being mixed.</p>

<p><a name="mixing"></a></p>

<h5>Finale: Trait Mixing</h5>

<p>I will conclude by showing the code for mixing tree node traits and collection traits, which is elegant.  Here are type definitions for tree nodes and collection traits that inherit from incrementable values, nearest-key queries, and prefix-sum queries, and there is almost no code except the proper inheritances:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post I want to discuss several advantages of defining lightweight non-negative numeric types in Scala, whose primary benefit is that they allow improved type signatures for Scala functions and methods.  I&#8217;ll first describe the simple class definition, and then demonstrate how it can be used in function signatures and the benefits of doing so.</p>

<p>If the following ideas interest you at all, I highly recommend looking at the <a href="https://github.com/fthomas/refined">&#8216;refined&#8217; project</a> authored by <a href="http://timepit.eu/~frank/">Frank S. Thomas</a>, which generalizes on the ideas below and supports additional static checking functionalities via macros.</p>

<h5>A Non-Negative Integer Type</h5>

<p>As a working example, I&#8217;ll discuss a non-negative integer type <code>NonNegInt</code>.  My proposed definition is sufficiently lightweight to view as a single code block:</p>

<p>The notable properties and features of <code>NonNegInt</code> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>NonNegInt</code> is a value class around an <code>Int</code>, and so invokes no actual object construction or allocation</li>
<li>Its constructor is private, and so is safe from directly constructing around a negative integer</li>
<li>It supplies factory method <code>NonNegInt(v)</code> to construct a non negative integer value</li>
<li>It supplies implicit conversion from <code>Int</code> values to <code>NonNegInt</code></li>
<li>Both factory method and implicit conversion check for negative values.  There is no way to construct a <code>NonNegInt</code> that contains a negative integer value.</li>
<li>It also supplies implicit conversion from <code>NonNegInt</code> back to <code>Int</code>.  Moving back and forth between <code>Int</code> and <code>NonNegInt</code> is effectively transparent.</li>
</ul>


<p>The above properties work to make <code>NonNegInt</code> very lightweight with respect to size and runtime properties, and semantically safe in the sense that it is impossible to construct one with a negative value inside it.</p>

<h5>Application of <code>NonNegInt</code></h5>

<p>I primarily envision <code>NonNegInt</code> as an easy and informative way to declare function parameters that are only well defined for non-negative values, without the need to write any explicit checking code, and yet allowing the programmer to call the function with normal <code>Int</code> values, due to the implicit conversions:</p>

<p>This short example demonstrates some appealing properties of <code>NonNegInt</code>.  Firstly, the constraint that index <code>j &gt;= 0</code> is enforced via the type definition, and so the programmer does not have to write the usual <code>require(j &gt;= 0, ...)</code> check (or worry about forgetting it).  Secondly, the implicit conversion from <code>Int</code> to <code>NonNegInt</code> means the programmer can just provide a regular integer value for parameter <code>j</code>, instead of having to explicitly say <code>NonNegInt(1)</code>.  Third, the implicit conversion from <code>NonNegInt</code> to <code>Int</code> means that <code>j</code> can easily be used anywhere a regular <code>Int</code> is used.  Last, and very definitely not least, the fact that function <code>element</code> requires a non-negative integer is obvious <strong>right in the function signature</strong>.  There is no need for a programmer to guess whether <code>j</code> can be negative, and no need for the author of <code>element</code> to document that <code>j</code> cannot be negative.  Its type makes that completely clear.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>In this post I&#8217;ve laid out some advantages of defining lightweight non-negative numeric types, in particular using <code>NonNegInt</code> as a working example.  Clearly, if you want to apply this idea, you&#8217;d want to also define <code>NonNegLong</code>, <code>NonNegDouble</code>, <code>NonNegFloat</code> and for that matter <code>PosInt</code>, <code>PosLong</code>, etc.  Happy computing!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> - that is, directly drawing random samples from the distribution of how many elements would be skipped over between actual samples taken.</p>

<p>Another popular sampling algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">Reservoir Sampling</a>.  Its sampling logic is a bit more complicated than Bernoulli or Poisson sampling, in the sense that the probability of sampling any given (jth) element <em>changes</em>. For a sampling reservoir of size R, and all j>R, the probability of choosing element (j) is R/j.  You can see that the potential payoff for gap-sampling is big, particularly as data size becomes large; as (j) approaches infinity, the probability R/j goes to zero, and the corresponding gaps between samples grow without bound.</p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it requires that (1) you actually <em>know</em> the sampling distribution, and (2) that you can effectively draw values from that distribution faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.</p>

<p>With that goal in mind, I derived the probability mass function (pmf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the sampling gap distribution of reservoir sampling.  In this post I will show the derivations.</p>

<h3>The Sampling Gap Distribution</h3>

<p>In the interest of making it easy to get at the actual answers, here are the pmf and cdf for the Reservoir Sampling Gap Distribution.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>In the derivations that follow, I will keep to some conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>R = the sampling reservoir size.  R > 0.</li>
<li>j = the index of a data element being considered for sampling.  j > R.</li>
<li>k = the size of a gap between samples.  k >= 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>P(k) is the probability that the gap between one sample and the next is of size k.  The support for P(k) is over all k>=0.  I will generally assume that j>R, as the first R samples are always loaded into the reservoir and the actual random sampling logic starts at j=R+1.  The constraint j>R will also be relevant to many binomial coefficient expressions, where it ensures the coefficient is well defined.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Probability Mass Function, P(k)</h3>

<p>Suppose we just chose (randomly) to sample data element (j-1).  Now we are interested in the probability distribution of the next sampling gap.  That is, the probability P(k) that we will <em>not</em> sample the next (k) elements {j,j+1,&#8230;j+k-1}, and sample element (j+k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure1.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>By arranging the product terms in descending order as above, you can see that they can be written as factorial quotients:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Now we apply <a href="#LemmaA">Lemma A</a>.  The 2nd case (a&lt;=b) of the Lemma applies, since (j-1-R)&lt;=j, so we have:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure3.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>And so we have now derived a compact, closed-form expression for P(k).</p>

<h3>Deriving the Cumulative Distribution Function, F(k)</h3>

<p>Now that we have a derivation for the pmf P(k), we can tackle a derivation for the cdf.  First I will make note of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Series_involving_binomial_coefficients">useful identity</a> that I scraped off of Wikipedia (I substituted (x) => (a) and (k) => (b)):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/identity1.png" title="identity 1" alt="identity 1" /></p>

<p>The cumulative distribution function for the sampling gap, F(k), is of course just the sum over P(t), for (t) from 0 up to (k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure4.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This is a closed-form solution, but we can apply a bit more simplification:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure5.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>We have derived closed-form expressions for the pmf and cdf of the Reservoir Sampling gap distribution:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>In order to apply these results to a practical gap-sampling implementation of Reservoir Sampling, we would next need a way to efficiently sample from P(k), to obtain gap sizes to skip over.  How to accomplish this is an open question, but knowing a formula for P(k) and F(k) is a start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have been applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient">Kendall&#8217;s Tau</a> as an evaluation metric to assess how well a regression model ranks input samples, with respect to a known correct ranking.</p>

<p>The process of implementing the Kendall&#8217;s Tau statistic, with my software engineer&#8217;s hat on, caused me to reflect a bit on how it could be generalized beyond the traditional application of ranking numeric pairs.  In this post I&#8217;ll discuss the generalization of Kendall&#8217;s Tau to non-numeric data, and also generalizing from totally ordered data to partial orderings.</p>

<h5>A Review of Kendall&#8217;s Tau</h5>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with a brief review of Kendall&#8217;s Tau.  For more depth, a good place to start is the Wikipedia article at the link above.</p>

<p>Consider a sequence of (n) observations where each observation is a pair (x,y), where we wish to measure how well a ranking by x-values agrees with a ranking by the y-values.  Informally, Kendall&#8217;s Tau (aka the Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient) is the difference between number of observation-pairs (pairs of pairs, if you will) whose ordering <em>agrees</em> (&#8220;concordant&#8221; pairs) and the number of such pairs whose ordering <em>disagrees</em> (&#8220;discordant&#8221; pairs).  This difference is divided by the total number of observation pairs.</p>

<p>The commonly-used formulation of Kendall&#8217;s Tau is the &#8220;Tau-B&#8221; statistic, which accounts for observed pairs having tied values in either x or y as being neither concordant nor discordant:</p>

<h6>Figure 1: Kendall&#8217;s Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_1.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The formulation above has quadratic complexity, with respect to data size (n).  It is possible to rearrange this computation in a way that can be computed in (n)log(n) time[1]:</p>

<h6>Figure 2: An (n)log(n) formulation of Kendall&#8217;s Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_2.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The details of performing this computation can be found at [1] or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient#Algorithms">Wikipedia entry</a>.  For my purposes, I&#8217;ll note that it requires two (n)log(n) sorts of the data, which becomes relevant below.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Non-Numeric Values</h5>

<p>Generalizing Kendall&#8217;s Tau to non-numeric values is mostly just making the observation that the definition of &#8220;concordant&#8221; and &#8220;discordant&#8221; pairs is purely based on comparing x-values and y-values (and, in the (n)log(n) formulation, performing sorts on the data).  From the software engineer&#8217;s perspective this means that the computations are well defined on any data type with an ordering relation, which includes numeric types but also chars, strings, sequences of any element supporting an ordering, etc.  Significantly, most programming languages support the concept of defining ordering relations on arbitrary data types, which means that <em><em>Kendall&#8217;s Tau can, in principle, be computed on literally any kind of data structure</em></em>, provided you supply it with a well defined ordering.  Furthermore, an examination of the algorithms shows that values of x and y need not even be of the same type, nor do they require the same ordering.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Partial Orderings</h5>

<p>When I brought this observation up, my colleague <a href="http://chapeau.freevariable.com/">Will Benton</a> asked the very interesting question of whether it&#8217;s also possible to compute Kendall&#8217;s Tau on objects that have only a <em>partial ordering</em>.  It turns out that you <em><em>can</em></em> define Kendall&#8217;s Tau on partially ordered data, by defining the case of two non-comparable x-values, or y-values, as another kind of tie.</p>

<p>The big caveat with this definition is that the (n)log(n) optimization does not apply.  Firstly, the optimized algorithm relies heavily on (n)log(n) sorting, and there is no unique full sorting of elements that are only partially ordered.  Secondly, the formula&#8217;s definition of the quantities n1, n2 and n3 is founded on the assumption that element equality is transitive; this is why you can count a number of tied values, t, and use t(t-1)/2 as the corresponding number of tied pairs.  But in a partial ordering, this assumption is violated. Consider the case where (a) &lt; (b), but (a) is non-comparable to (c) and (b) is also non-comparable to (c).  By our definition, (a) is tied with (c), and (c) is tied with (b), but transitivity is violated, as (a) &lt; (b).</p>

<p>So how <em>can</em> we compute Tau in this case?  Consider (n1) and (n2), in Figure-1.  These values represent the number of pairs that were tied wrt (x) and (y), respectively.  We can&#8217;t use the shortcut formulas for (n1) and (n2), but we can count them directly, pair by pair, simply by conducting the traditional quadratic iteration over pairs, and incrementing (n1) whenever two x-values are noncomparable, and incrementing (n2) whenever two y-values are non-comparable, just as we increment (nc) and (nd) to count concordant and discordant pairs.  With this modification, we can apply the formula in Figure-1 as-is.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>I made these observations without any particular application in mind. However, my instincts as a software engineer tell me that making generalizations in this way often paves the way for new ideas, once the generalized concept is made available.  With luck, it will inspire either me or somebody else to apply Kendall&#8217;s Tau in interesting new ways.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scala supplies a <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">parallel collections library</a> that was designed to make it easy for a programmer to add parallel computing over the elements in a collection.  In this post, I will describe a case study of applying Scala&#8217;s parallel collections to cleanly implement multithreading support for training a K-Medoids clustering model.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">K-Medoids clustering</a> is a relative of K-Means clustering that does not require an algebra over input data elements.  That is, K-Medoids requires only a distance metric defined on elements in the data space, and can cluster objects which do not have a well-defined concept of addition or division that is necessary for computing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid">centroids</a> required by K-Means.  For example, K-Medoids can cluster character strings, which have a notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">distance</a>, but no notion of summation that could be used to compute a geometric centroid.</p>

<p>This additional generality comes at a cost.  The medoid of a collection of elements is the member of the collection that minimizes some function F of the distances from that element to all the other elements in the collection.  For example, F might be the sum of distances from one element to all the elements, or perhaps the maximum distance, etc.  <strong>It is not hard to see that the cost of computing a medoid of (n) elements is quadratic in (n)</strong>: Evaluating F is linear in (n) and F in turn must be evaluated with respect to each element.  Furthermore, unlike centroid-based computations used in K-Means, computing a medoid does not naturally lend itself to common scale-out computing formalisms such as Spark RDDs, due to the full-cross-product nature of the computation.</p>

<p>With this in mind, a more traditional multithreading approach is a good candidate to achieve some practical parallelism on modern multi-core hardware.  I&#8217;ll demonstrate that this is easy to implement in Scala with parallel sequences.</p>

<h3>Non-Parallel Code</h3>

<p>Consider a baseline non-parallel implementation of K-Medoids, as in the following example skeleton code.  (A working version of this code, under review at the time of this post, can be <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/parseq_blog/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/cluster/KMedoids.scala">viewed here</a>)</p>

<p>If we run the code above (de-skeletonized), then we might see something like this output from our benchmarking, where I clustered a dataset of 40,000 randomly-generated (x,y,z) points by Gaussian sampling around 5 chosen centers.  (This data is numeric, but I provide only a distance metric on the points.  K-Medoids has no knowledge of the data except that it can run the given metric function on it):</p>

<p>Observe that cluster sizes are generally not the same, and we can see the time per cluster varying quadratically with respect to cluster size.</p>

<h3>A First Take On Parallel K-Medoids</h3>

<p>Studying our non-parallel code above, we can see that the computation of each new medoid is independent, which makes it a likely place to inject some parallelism. A Scala sequence can be transformed into a corresponding parallel sequence using the <code>par</code> method, and so parallelizing our code is literally this simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Parallelizing a collection with .par </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this block, I also apply <code>.seq</code> at the end, which is not always necessary but can avoid type mismatches between <code>Seq[T]</code> and <code>ParSeq[T]</code> under some circumstances.</p>

<p>In my case I also wish to exercise some control over the threading used by the parallelism, and so I explicitly assign a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread pool to the sequence:</p>

<p>Minor grievance: it would be nice if Scala supported some &#8216;in-line&#8217; methods, like <code>seq.par(n)...</code> and <code>seq.par(threadPool)...</code>, instead of requiring the programmer to break the flow of the code to invoke <code>tasksupport =</code>, which returns <code>Unit</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve parallelized our K-Medoids training, we should see how well it responds to additional threads.  I ran the above parallelized version using <code>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}</code> threads, on a machine with 40 cores, so that my benchmarking would not be impacted by attempting to run more threads than there are cores to support them.  I also ran two versions of test data.  The first I generated with clusters of equal size (5 clusters of ~8000 elements), and the second with one cluster being twice as large (1 cluster of ~13300 and 4 clusters of ~6700).  Following is a plot of throughput (iterations / second) versus threads:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/parseq/by_cluster_1.png" title="Throughput As A Function Of Threads" ></p>

<p>In the best of all possible worlds, our throughput would increase linearly with the number of threads; double the threads, double our iterations per second.  Instead, our throughput starts to increase nicely as we add threads, but hits a hard ceiling at 8 threads.  It is not hard to see why: our parallelism is limited by the number of elements in our collection of clusters.  In our case that is k = 5, and so we reach our ceiling at 8 threads, the first thread number >= 5.  Furthermore, we see that when the size of clusters is unequal, the throughput suffers even more.  The time required to complete the clustering is dominated by the most expensive element.  In our case, the cluster that is twice the size of other clusters:</p>

</span><span class='line'>Run time for medoids = 19.9</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Take 2: Improving The Use Of Threads</h3>

<p>Fortunately it is not hard to improve on this situation.  If parallelizing by cluster is too coarse, we can try pushing our parallelism down one level of granularity.  In our case, that means parallelizing the outer loop of our medoid function, and it is just as easy as before:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Parallelize the outer loop of medoid computation </span></figcaption>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that I retained the previous parallelism at the cluster level, otherwise the algorithm would execute parallel medoids, but one cluster at a time.  Also observe that we are applying the same thread pool we supplied to the ParSeq at the cluster level.  Scala&#8217;s parallel logic can utilize the same thread pool at multiple granularities without blocking.  This makes it very clean to control the total number of threads used by some computation, by simply re-using the same threadpool across all points of parallelism.</p>

<p>Now, when we re-run our experiment, we see that our throughput continues to increase as we add threads.  The following plot illustrates the throughput increasing in comparison to the previous ceiling, and also that throughput is less sensitive to the cluster size, as threads can be allocated flexibly across clusters as they are available:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/parseq/all_1.png" title="Thread utilization improves at finer granularity" ></p>

<p>I hope this short case study has demonstrated how easy it is to add multithreading to computations with Scala parallel sequences, and some considerations for making the best use of available threads.  Happy Parallel Programming!</p>
