  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been considering models for the effects of HTCondor negotiation cycle cadence on pool loading and accounting group starvation, which led me to thinking about the effects of taking the modulus of a random variable, for reasons I plan to discuss in future posts.</p>

<p>When you take the modulus of a random variable, X, the corresponding expected value E[X mod m] is not equal to E[X] mod m.  Consider the following example:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rv_modulus_mean.png" title="An example demonstrating that E[X mod m] != E[X] mod m" alt="Random Variable Images" /></p>

<p>As we see from the example above, the random variables X and Y have the same mean:  E[X] = E[Y] = 0.75, however E[X mod 1] = 0.75 while E[Y mod 1] = 0.5.  One implication is that computing the moments of the modulus of random variables must be on a per-distribution basis, perhaps via monte carlo methods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>HTCondor supports a notion of aggregate compute resources known as partitionable slots (p-slots), which may be consumed by multiple jobs.   Historically, at most one job could be matched against such a slot in a single negotiation cycle, which limited the rate at which partitionable slot resources could be utilized.  More recently, the scheduler has been enhanced with logic to allow it to acquire multiple claims against a partitionable slot, which increases the p-slot utilization rate. However, as this potentially bypasses the negotiator&#8217;s accounting of global pool resources such as accounting group quotas and concurrency limits, it places some contraints on what jobs can can safely acquire multiple claims against any particular p-slot: for example, only other jobs on the same scheduler can be considered.  Additionally, candidate job requirements must match the requirements of the job that originally matched in the negotiator.  Another significant impact is that the negotiator is still forced to match an entire p-slot, which may have a large match cost (weight): these large match costs cause <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">accounting difficulties</a> when submitter shares and/or group quotas drop below the cost of a slot.  This particular problem is growing steadily larger, as machines with ever-larger numbers of cores and other resources appear in HTCondor pools.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to scheduler-side resource consumption is to enhance the negotiator with the ability to match multiple jobs against a resource (p-slot) &#8211; negotiator-side resource consumption.   The advantages of negotiator-side consumption are that it places fewer limitations on what jobs can consume a given resource.  The negotiator already handles global resource accounting, and so jobs are not required to adhere to the same requirements expression to safely consume assets from the same resource.  Furthermore, jobs from any scheduler may be considered.  Each match is only charged the cost of resources consumed, and so p-slots with large amounts of resources do not cause difficulties with large match costs.   Another considerable benefit of this approach is that it facilitates the support of <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/no-longer-thinking-in-slots-thinking-in-aggregate-resources-and-consumption-policies/">configurable resource consumption policies</a></p>

<p>I have developed a working draft of negotiator-side resource consumption on my HTCondor github fork, topic branch <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/htcondor/tree/V7_9-prototype-negside-pslot-splits">V7_9-prototype-negside-pslot-splits</a> which also implements support for configurable resource consumption policies.   I will briefly demonstrate this implementation and some of its advantages below.</p>

<p>First I will demonstrate an example with a consumption policy that is essentially equivalent to HTCondor&#8217;s current default policies.  Consider this configuration:</p>

<pre><code># spoof some cores
NUM_CPUS = 10

# configure an aggregate resource (p-slot) to consume
SLOT_TYPE_1 = 100%
SLOT_TYPE_1_PARTITIONABLE = True
# declare multiple claims for negotiator to use
# may also use global: NUM_CLAIMS
SLOT_TYPE_1_NUM_CLAIMS = 20
NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 1

# turn off schedd-side resource splitting since we're demonstrating neg-side alternative
CLAIM_PARTITIONABLE_LEFTOVERS = False

# turn this off to demonstrate that consumption policy will handle this kind of logic
MUST_MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS = False

# configure a consumption policy.   This policy is modeled on
# current 'modify-request-exprs' defaults:
# "my" is resource ad, "target" is job ad
STARTD_EXPRS = ConsumptionCpus, ConsumptionMemory, ConsumptionDisk
ConsumptionCpus = quantize(target.RequestCpus, {1})
ConsumptionMemory = quantize(target.RequestMemory, {128})
ConsumptionDisk = quantize(target.RequestDisk, {1024})
# swap doesn't seem to be actually supported in resource accounting

# keep slot weights enabled for match costing
NEGOTIATOR_USE_SLOT_WEIGHTS = True

# weight used to derive match cost: W(before-consumption) - W(after-consumption)
SlotWeight = Cpus

# for simplicity, turn off preemption, caching, worklife
CLAIM_WORKLIFE=0
MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME = 3600
PREEMPT = False
RANK = 0
PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS = False
NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION = False
NEGOTIATOR_MATCHLIST_CACHING = False

# verbose logging
ALL_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG

# reduce daemon update latencies
NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL = 30
SCHEDD_INTERVAL = 15
</code></pre>

<p>In the above configuration, we declare a typical aggregate (that is, partitionable) resource <code>SLOT_TYPE_1</code>, but then we also configure a <em>consumption policy</em>, by advertising <code>ConsumptionCpus</code>, <code>ConsumptionMemory</code> and <code>ConsumptionDisk</code>.  Note that these are defined with quantizing expressions currently used as default values for the <code>MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS</code> behavior.  The startd and the negotiatior will <em>both</em> use these expressions by examining the slot ads.</p>

<p>Next, we submit 15 jobs.  Note that this more than the 10 cores advertised by the p-slot:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = 60
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
queue 15
</code></pre>

<p>If we watch the negotiator log, we will see that negotiator matches the 10 jobs supported by the p-slot on the next cycle (note that it uses slot1 each time):</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-'  -e 'matched
12/03/12 11:53:10 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 11:53:25 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>condor_q</code> to verify that the 10 jobs subsequently run.   The jobs run against 10 dynamic slots (d-slots) in the standard way:</p>

<pre><code>$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotCpus
slot1@rorschach | 10
slot1_10@rorschach | 1
slot1_1@rorschach | 1
slot1_2@rorschach | 1
slot1_3@rorschach | 1
slot1_4@rorschach | 1
slot1_5@rorschach | 1
slot1_6@rorschach | 1
slot1_7@rorschach | 1
slot1_8@rorschach | 1
slot1_9@rorschach | 1
</code></pre>

<p>Next we consider altering the resource consumption policy.  As a simple example, suppose we wish to allocate memory more coarsely.  We could alter the configuration above by changing <code>ConsumptionMemory</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>ConsumptionMemory = quantize(target.RequestMemory, {512})
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps we then also want to express match cost in a memory-centric way, instead of the usual cpu-centric way:</p>

<pre><code>SlotWeight = floor(Memory / 512)
</code></pre>

<p>Here it is worth noting that in this implementation of negotiator-side consumption, the cost of a match is defined as W(S) - W(S&#8217;), where W(S) is the weight of the slot <em>prior</em> to consuming resources from the match and consumption policy, and W(S`) is the weight evaluated for the slot <em>after</em> those resources are subtracted.  This modification enables multiple matches to be made against a single p-slot, and furthermore it paves the way to possible avenues for a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/26/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-computing-claim-capacity-from-consumption-policy/">better unit analysis of slot weights and accounting groups</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing the example, if we re-run the example with this new consumption policy, we should see that memory limits reduce the number of jobs matched against <code>slot1</code> to 3:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-'  -e 'matched'
12/03/12 12:58:22 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 12:58:37 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
</code></pre>

<p>Examining the slot memory assets, we see that there is insufficient memory for a fourth match when our consumption policy sets the minimum at 512:</p>

<pre><code>$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotMemory
slot1@rorschach | 1903
slot1_1@rorschach | 512
slot1_2@rorschach | 512
slot1_3@rorschach | 512
</code></pre>

<p>As a final example, I&#8217;ll demonstrate the positive impact of negotiator side matching on interactions with accounting groups (or submitter shares).  Again returning to my original example, modify the configuration with a simple accounting group policy:</p>

<pre><code>GROUP_NAMES = a
GROUP_QUOTA_a = 1
GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS = False
GROUP_AUTOREGROUP = False
</code></pre>

<p>Now submit 2 jobs against accounting group <code>a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = 60
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
+AccountingGroup="a.u"
queue 2
</code></pre>

<p>We see that accounting groups are respected: one job runs, and it does not suffer from insufficient share to acquire resources from <code>slot1</code> <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">(GT3013)</a>, because match cost is computed using only the individual job&#8217;s impact on slot weight, instead of being required to match the entire p-slot:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f ~/condor/local/log/NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-' -e matched
12/03/12 14:57:50 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 14:58:08 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 14:58:08       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 14:58:09 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------

$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotCpus
slot1@rorschach | 10
slot1_1@rorschach | 1
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In two previous posts, I made a case to motivate the need for a better definition of slot weights and group quotas that could accommodate use cases involving aggregate resources (partitionable slots) with heterogeneous consumption policies and also provide a principled unit analysis for weights and quotas.  These previous posts can be viewed here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/13/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-for-heterogeneous-and-multidimensional-compute-resources/">Rethinking the Semantics of Group Quotas and Slot Weights for Heterogeneous and Multidimensional Compute Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/15/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-claim-capacity-model/">Rethinking the Semantics of Group Quotas and Slot Weights: Claim Capacity Model</a></li>
</ul>


<p>As previously mentioned, a Claim Capacity Model of accounting group quotas and slot weights (or &#8220;resource consumption costs&#8221;) requires a resource claiming model that assigns a well defined finite value for the maximum number of claims that each resource and its consumption policy can support.  It must also be re-evaluatable on a resource as its assets are consumed, so that the cost of a proposed claim (or match, in negotiation-speak) can be defined as W(R) - W(R&#8217;), were R&#8217; embodies the amounts of all assets remaining after the claim has taken its share.  (Here, I will be using the term &#8216;assets&#8217; to refer to quantities such as cpus, memory, disk, swap or any <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/extensible-machine-resources/">extensible resources</a> defined, to clarify the difference between an aggregate resource (i.e. a partitionable slot) versus a single resource dimension such as cpus, memory, etc).</p>

<p>This almost immediately raises the question of how best to define such a resource claiming model.  In this post I will briefly describe a few possible approaches, focusing on models which are easy reason about, easy to configure and additionally allow claim capacity for a resource - W(R) - to be computed automatically for the user, thus making a sane relationship between consumption policies and consumption costs possible to enforce.</p>

<h3>Approach 1: fixed claim consumption model</h3>

<p>The simplest-possible approach is arguably to just directly configure a fixed number, M, of claims attached to a resource.  In this model, each match of a job against a resource consumes one of the M claims.   Here, match cost W(R) - W(R&#8217;) = 1 in all cases, and is independent of the &#8216;size&#8217; of assets consumed from a resource.</p>

<p>A possible use case for such a model is that one might wish to declare that a resource can run up to a certain number of jobs, without assigning any particular cost to consuming individual assets.  If the pool users&#8217; workload consists of large numbers of resource-cheap jobs that can effectively share cpu, memory, etc, then such a model might be a good fit.</p>

<h3>Approach 2: configure asset quantization levels</h3>

<p>Another approach that makes the relation between consumption policy and claim capacity easy to think about is to configure a quantization level for each resource asset.  For example, here we might quantize memory into 20 levels, i.e. Q(memory) = 20.  Similarly we might define Q(cpus) = 10 (note that HTCondor does not currently handle fractional cpus on resources, but this kind of model would benefit if floating point asset fractions were supported).  At any time, a resource R has some number q(a) left of the original Q(a).  A job requests an amount r(a) for asset (a).   Here, a claim gets a quantized approximation of any requested asset = V(a)(n(a)/Q(a)), where V(a) is the total original value available for asset (a), and n(a) = ceiling(r(a)Q(a)/V(a)).   Here there are two possible sub-policies.  If we demand that each claim consume >= 1 quantum of every asset (i.e. n(a) >= 1), then the claim capacity W(R) is the minimum of q(a), for (a) over all assets.  However, if a claim is allowed to consume a zero quantity of some individual assets (n(a)=0), then the claim capacity is the <em>maximum</em> of the q(a).   In this case, one must address the corner case of a claim attempting to consume (n(a)=0) over all assets.  The resulting resource R&#8217; has q&#8217;(a) = q(a)-n(a), and W(R&#8217;) is the minium (or maximum) over the new q&#8217;(a).</p>

<h3>Approach 3: configure minimum asset charges</h3>

<p>A third approach is to configure a <em>minimum</em> amount of each asset that any claim must be charged.   For example, we might define a minimum amount of memory C(memory) to charge any claim.   If a job requests an amount r(a), it will always receive max(r(a), C(a)).  As above, q(a) is the number of quanta currently available for asset (a).  Let v(a) be the amount of (a) currently available.  Here we define q(a) for an asset (a) to be floor(v(a)/C(a)).   If we adhere to a reasonable restriction that C(a) must be strictly > 0 for all (a), we are guaranteed a well defined W(R) = min over the q(a).</p>

<p>It is an open question which of these models (or some other completely different options) should be supported.  Conceivably all of them could be provided as options.</p>

<p>Currently my personal preference leans toward Approach 3.  It is easy to reason about and configure.  It yields a well defined W(R) in all circumstances, with no corner cases, that is straightforward to compute and enforce automatically.  It is easy to configure heterogeneous consumption policies that cost different resource assets in different ways, simply by tuning minimum charge C(a) appropriately for each asset.  This includes claim capacity models where jobs are assumed to use very small amounts of any resource, including fractional shares of cpu assets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my previous post about <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/13/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-for-heterogeneous-and-multidimensional-compute-resources">Rethinking the Semantics of Group Quotas and Slot Weights</a>, I proposed a concept for unifying the semantics of accounting group quotas and slot weights across arbitrary resource allocation strategies.</p>

<p>My initial terminology was that the weight of a slot (i.e. resource ad) is a measure of the <em>maximum</em> number of jobs that might match against that ad, given the currently available resource quantities and the allocation policy.  The cost of a match becomes the amount by which that measure is reduced, after the match&#8217;s resources are removed from the ad.</p>

<p>In the HTCondor vocabulary, a job acquires a <em>claim</em> on resources to actually run after it has been matched.  It has been proposed that it may be beneficial for HTCondor to evolve toward a model where there are (aggregate) resource ads, and claims against those ads, as a simplification of the current model which involves static, partitionable and dynamic slots, with claims.  With this in mind, a preferable terminology for group quota and weight semantics might be that a resource ad (or slot) has a measure of the maximum number of claims it could dispense: a <em>claim capacity</em> measure.  The cost of a claim (or match) is the corresponding reduction of the resource&#8217;s claim capacity.</p>

<p>So, this semantic model could be referred to as the Claim Capacity Model of group quotas and slot weights.  With this terminology, the shared &#8216;unit&#8217; for group quotas and slot weights would be <em>claims</em> instead of <em>jobs</em>.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The HTCondor semantic for accounting group quotas and slot weights is currently cpu-centric.  This is an artifact of the historic primacy of cpu as the most commonly-considered limiting resource in computations.  For example the <code>SlotWeight</code> attribute is currently defaulted to <code>Cpus</code>, and when slot weights are disabled, there is logic activated in matchmaking to sum the available cpus on slots to avoid &#8216;undercounting&#8217; total pool quotas.</p>

<p>However, HTCondor slots &#8211; the core model of computational resources in an HTCondor pool &#8211; manage four resources by default: cpu, memory, disk and swap.  Furthermore, slots may now be configured with arbitrary custom resources.  As recently mentioned by <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/no-longer-thinking-in-slots-thinking-in-aggregate-resources-and-consumption-policies">Matthew Farrellee</a>, there is a growing pressure to provide robust support not just for traditional cpu-centric resource presentation, usage and allocation, but also seamlessly mediated with memory-centric, gpu-centric or &#8216;*&#8217;-centric resource allocation policies and more generally allocation policies that are simultaneously aware of all resource dimensions.</p>

<p>This goal immediately raises some questions for the semantics of accounting groups and slot weights when matching jobs against slots during matchmaking.</p>

<p>Consider a pool where 50% of the slots are &#8216;weighted&#8217; in a traditional cpu-centric way, but the other 50% are intended to be allocated in a memory-centric way.  This is currently possible, as the <code>SlotWeight</code> attribute can be configured appropriately to be a function of either <code>Cpus</code> or <code>Memory</code>.</p>

<p>But in a scenario where slots are weighted as functions of heterogeneous resource dimensions, it raises a semantic question:  when we sum these weights to obtain the pool-wide available quota, what &#8216;real world&#8217; quantity does this total represent &#8211; if any?   Is it a purely heuristic numeric value with no well defined unit attached?</p>

<p>This question has import.  Understanding what the answer is, or should be, impacts what story we tell to users about what their accounting group configuration actually means.  When I assign a quota to an accounting group in such a heterogeneous environment, what is that quota regulating?   When a job matches a cpu-centric slot, does the cost of that match have a different meaning than when matching against a memory-centric slot?   When the slots are partitionable, a match implies a certain multi-dimensional slice of resources allocated from that slot.  What is the cost of that slice?  Does the sum of costs add up to the original weight on the partitionable slot?  If not, how does that affect our understanding of quota semantics?</p>

<p>It may be possible unify all of these ideas by adopting the perspective that a slot&#8217;s weight is a measure of the maximum number of jobs that can be matched against it.  The cost of a match is W(S)-W(S&#8217;), where W(S) is the weight function evaluated on the slot prior to match, and W(S&#8217;) is the corresponding weight after the match has extracted its requested resources.  The pool&#8217;s total quota is just the sum of W(S), over all slots S in the pool.  Note, this implies that the &#8216;unit&#8217; attached to both slot weights and accounting group quotas is &#8216;jobs&#8217;.</p>

<p>Consider a simple example from the traditional cpu-centric configuration:   A partitionable slot is configured with 8 cpus, and <code>SlotWeight</code> is just its default <code>Cpus</code>.  Using this model, the allocation policy is: &#8216;each match must use >= 1 cpu&#8221;, and that other resource requests are assumed to be not limiting.  The maximum number of matches is 8 jobs, each requesting 1 cpu.   However, a job might also request 2 cpus.  In this case, note that the cost of the match is 2, since the remaining slot has 6 slots, and so W(S&#8217;) now evaluates to 6.   So, the cost of the match is how many fewer possible jobs the original slot can support after the match takes its requested resources.</p>

<p>This approach can be applied equally well to a memory-centric strategy, or a disk centric strategy, or a gpu-based strategy, or any combination simultaneously.  All weights evaluate to a value with unit &#8216;jobs&#8217;.   All match costs are differences between weights (before and after match), and so their values are also in units of &#8216;jobs&#8217;.  Therefore, the semantics of the sum of weights over a pool is always well defined: it is a number of jobs, and spefically a measure of the maximum number of jobs that might match against all the slots in the pool.  When a match acquires resources that reduce this maximum by more than 1 job, that is not in any way inconsistent.  It means the job used resources that might have supported two or more &#8216;smaller&#8217; jobs.   This means that accounting group quotas (and submitter shares) also have a well defined unit and semantic, which is &#8216;how many (or what fraction of) the maximum possible jobs is this group guaranteed by my accounting policy&#8217;</p>

<p>One implication of this proposed semantic for quotas and weights is that the measure for the maximum number of jobs that may match against any given slot must be some finite number.   It implies that all resource dimensions are quantized in some way by the allocation policy.   This scheme would not support a real-valued resource dimension that had no minimum quantization.  I do not think that this is a very heavy-weight requirement, and in fact we have already been moving in that direction with features such as MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS_xxx.</p>

<p>When a slot&#8217;s resource allocation policy is defined over all its resources, what bounds this measure of maximum possible matches?  In a case where each job match <em>must</em> use at least one non-zero quantum of each resource dimension, then the limit is the resource with the mimimum quantized levels.   In a case where jobs may request a zero amount of resources, then the limit is the resource with the maximum quantized levels.  (note, it is required that each match use at least one quantum of at least one resource, otherwise the maximum is not properly bounded).</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post I will describe how to use HTCondor accounting groups with <a href="http://getwallaby.com">Wallaby</a>.  I will begin by walking through an accounting group configuration on a pool managed by wallaby.  Following, I will demonstrate the configuration in action.</p>

<p>The gist of this demo will be to create a simple accounting group hierarchy:  A top-level group called <code>Demo</code>, and three child groups <code>Demo.A, Demo.B, Demo.C</code>.  <code>Demo</code> will be given a <em>static</em> quota to simulate the behavior of a pool with a particular number of slots available.  The child groups will use <em>dynamic</em> quotas to express their quota shares from the parent as ratios.</p>

<p>First, it is good practice to snapshot current wallaby configuration for reference:</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby make-snapshot "pre demo state"
</code></pre>

<p>We will be constructing a wallaby feature called <code>AccountingGroups</code> to hold our accounting group configurations.  This creates the feature:</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby add-feature AccountingGroups
</code></pre>

<p>Wallaby wants to know about features that are used in configurations, so begin by declaring them to the wallaby store:</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby add-param GROUP_NAMES
$ wallaby add-param GROUP_QUOTA_Demo
$ wallaby add-param GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.A
$ wallaby add-param GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.B
$ wallaby add-param GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.C
$ wallaby add-param GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS_Demo
$ wallaby add-param NEGOTIATOR_ALLOW_QUOTA_OVERSUBSCRIPTION
$ wallaby add-param NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION
$ wallaby add-param CLAIM_WORKLIFE
</code></pre>

<p>Here we disable the &#8220;claim worklife&#8221; feature by setting claims to expire immediately.   This prevents jobs under one accounting group from acquiring surplus quota and holding on to it when new jobs arrive under a different group:</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby add-params-to-feature ExecuteNode CLAIM_WORKLIFE=0
$ wallaby add-params-to-subsystem startd CLAIM_WORKLIFE
$ wallaby add-params-to-feature Scheduler CLAIM_WORKLIFE=0
$ wallaby add-params-to-subsystem scheduler CLAIM_WORKLIFE
</code></pre>

<p>If you alter the configuration parameters, you will want the negotiator to reconfigure itself when you activate.  Here we declare the accounting group features as part of the negotiator subsystem:</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby add-params-to-subsystem negotiator \
GROUP_NAMES \
GROUP_QUOTA_Demo \
GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.A \
GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.B \
GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.C \
NEGOTIATOR_ALLOW_QUOTA_OVERSUBSCRIPTION \
NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION
</code></pre>

<p>Activate the configuration so far to tell subsystems about new parameters for reconfig</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby activate
</code></pre>

<p>Now we construct the actual configuration as the <code>AccountingGroups</code> wallaby feature.  Here we are constructing a group <code>Demo</code> with three subgroups <code>Demo.{A|B|C}</code>.  In a multi-node pool with several cores, it is often easiest to play with group behavior by creating a sub-hierarchy such as this <code>Demo</code> sub-hierarchy, and configuring <code>GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS_Demo=False</code>, so that the sub-hierarchy behaves with a well-defined total slot quota (in this case 15).  The sub-groups A,B and C each take 1/3 of the parent&#8217;s quota, so in this example each will receive 5 slots.</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby add-params-to-feature AccountingGroups \
NEGOTIATOR_ALLOW_QUOTA_OVERSUBSCRIPTION=False \
NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION=False \
GROUP_NAMES='Demo, Demo.A, Demo.B, Demo.C' \
GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS=True \
GROUP_QUOTA_Demo=15 \
GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS_Demo=False \
GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.A=0.333 \
GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.B=0.333 \
GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_Demo.C=0.333
</code></pre>

<p>With our accounting group feature created, we can apply it to the machine our negotiator daemon is running on.  Then snapshot our configuration modifications for reference, and activate the new configuration:</p>

<pre><code>$ wallaby add-features-to-node negotiator.node.com AccountingGroups
$ wallaby make-snapshot 'new acct group config'
$ wallaby activate
</code></pre>

<p>Now we will demonstrate the new feature in action.  Submit the following file to your pool, which submits 100 jobs each to groups <code>Demo.A</code> with durations randomly chosen between 25 and 35 seconds:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = $$([25 + random(11)])
transfer_executable = false
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
+AccountingGroup="Demo.A.user1"
queue 100
</code></pre>

<p>Once you make this submission, allow the jobs to negotiate, and you can check to see what accounting groups are running on slots by inspecting the value of <code>RemoteNegotiatingGroup</code> on slot ads.   You should see that subgroup <code>Demo.A</code> has acquired surplus and is running 15 jobs, as there are no jobs under groups <code>Demo.B</code> or <code>Demo.C</code> that need slots.  Note, due to jobs completing between negotiation cycles, these numbers can be less than the maximum possible at certain times.  If you have any other slots in the pool, they will show up in the output below as having either <code>undefined</code> negotiating group or possibly <code>&lt;none&gt;</code> if any other jobs are running.</p>

<pre><code>$ condor_status -format "%s\n" 'ifThenElse(RemoteNegotiatingGroup isnt undefined, string(RemoteNegotiatingGroup), "undefined")' -constraint 'True' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{ print $0; t += $1 } END { printf("%7d total\n",t) }'
 15 Demo.A
 50 &lt;none&gt;
 50 undefined
115 total
</code></pre>

<p>Now submit some jobs against <code>Demo.B</code> and <code>Demo.C</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = $$([25 + random(11)])
transfer_executable = false
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
+AccountingGroup="Demo.B.user1"
queue 100
+AccountingGroup="Demo.C.user1"
queue 100
</code></pre>

<p>Once these jobs begin to negotiate, we expect to see the jobs balanced between the three groups evenly, as we gave each group 1/3 of the quota:</p>

<pre><code>$ condor_status -format "%s\n" 'ifThenElse(RemoteNegotiatingGroup isnt undefined, string(RemoteNegotiatingGroup), "undefined")' -constraint 'True' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{ print $0; t += $1 } END { printf("%7d total\n",t) }'
  5 Demo.A
  5 Demo.B
  5 Demo.C
 50 &lt;none&gt;
 50 undefined
115 total
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we see what happens if we remove jobs under <code>Demo.B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ condor_rm -constraint 'AccountingGroup =?= "Demo.B.user1"'
</code></pre>

<p>Now we should see quota start to share between <code>Demo.A</code> and <code>Demo.C</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ condor_status -format "%s\n" 'ifThenElse(RemoteNegotiatingGroup isnt undefined, string(RemoteNegotiatingGroup), "undefined")' -constraint 'True' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{ print $0; t += $1 } END { printf("%7d total\n",t) }'
  7 Demo.A
  8 Demo.C
 50 &lt;none&gt;
 50 undefined
115 total
</code></pre>

<p>With this accounting group configuration in place, you can play with changing quotas for the accounting groups and observe the numbers of running jobs change in response.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In some cases, when testing or demonstrating the performance of an HTCondor pool, it is useful to submit a plug of jobs with randomized running times.  The standard technique for controlling run times is to submit a classic &#8216;sleep&#8217; job.  However, randomizing the argument to sleep is another matter.  Luckily there is an easy way to do this with a single submit file, using delayed evaluation syntax.</p>

<p>A classad expression placed inside of a special enclosure, like this: <code>$$([ &lt;expr&gt; ])</code>, causes <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> to be evaluated at the time the job ad is matched with a slot.  You can read more about delayed evaluation <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.8/condor_submit.html#78367">here</a>.  Consider the following example submit file:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
executable = /bin/sleep

# generate a random sleep duration when job is matched
args = $$([25 + random(11)])

# boilerplate to avoid file transfers and notifications
transfer_executable = false
should_transfer_files = no
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
notification = never

# generate 100 copies of this job - each will evaluate the
# randomizing expression independently
queue 100
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the example above, the value of <code>args</code> is set to the delayed evaluation expression <code>$$([25 + random(11)])</code>, which will evaluate the classad expression <code>25 + random(11)</code> when each job ad matches a slot to run.  The <code>queue 100</code> command generates 100 separate job ads, and so the net effect is 100 jobs, which will each run a sleep job with a duration <em>randomly chosen</em> between 25 and 35.</p>

<p>If we submit this file to a condor pool, and let the jobs run to completion, we can check the pool history file to see how the <code>Args</code> attribute was set on the job ad using the special generative attribute <code>MATCH_EXP_Args</code>, and the <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/06/29/easy-histograms-and-tables-from-condor-jobs-and-slots/">cchist tool</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ cchist condor_history 'MATCH_EXP_Args'
     11 25
      7 26
     10 27
      9 28
      7 29
     13 30
      8 31
      7 32
      8 33
      9 34
     11 35
    100 total
</code></pre>

<p>We can also sanity check our measure of actual run time, to see that those values are close to our values of <code>Args</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ cchist condor_history 'CompletionDate-JobCurrentStartDate'
      1 25
     11 26
      9 27
      8 28
      9 29
      9 30
     12 31
      4 32
      8 33
     10 34
     12 35
      6 36
      1 37
    100 total
</code></pre>

<p>Have fun with easy random sleep jobs!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have written an Octopress plugin to allow turnkey support for hosting a blog feed aggregator, in Octopress idiomatic style.  I will describe the steps to install it and use it below.  Some of its current features are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy configuration and deployment, providing all feed aggregator parameters as yaml front-matter</li>
<li>Turn-key generation of feed aggregator pages, in the configured site style</li>
<li>Optional generation of a &#8216;meta-feed&#8217; in atom.xml format, from aggregated feed entries</li>
<li>Automatic removal of duplicate feed list urls, and automatic removal of duplicate posts (e.g. if multiple category feeds from the same author are listed)</li>
<li>Automatic generation of feed author list as an Octopress &#8216;aside&#8217;</li>
<li>Inclusion/exclusion of posts based on number of posts and/or post age</li>
<li>Display of full or summary content based on number of posts and/or post age</li>
</ul>


<h3>Install the feed_aggregator.rb plugin</h3>

<p>Currently, you can obtain a copy of &#8220;feed_aggregator.rb&#8221; here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/octopress/blob/feed_aggregator/plugins/feed_aggregator.rb">feed_aggregator.rb</a></p>

<p>Simply copy this file into the plugins directory for your octopress repo:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp feed_aggregator.rb /path/to/your/octopress/repo/plugins
</code></pre>

<h3>Install feed aggregator layout files</h3>

<p>You can obtain a copy of the layout files here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/octopress/blob/feed_aggregator/.themes/classic/source/_layouts/feed_aggregator.html">feed_aggregator.html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/octopress/blob/feed_aggregator/.themes/classic/source/_layouts/feed_aggregator_page.html">feed_aggregator_page.html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/octopress/blob/feed_aggregator/.themes/classic/source/_layouts/feed_aggregator_meta.xml">feed_aggregator_meta.xml</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Copy the layouts files to your &#8216;_layouts&#8217; directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp feed_aggregator.html /path/to/your/octopress/repo/source/_layouts
$ cp feed_aggregator_page.html /path/to/your/octopress/repo/source/_layouts
$ cp feed_aggregator_meta.xml /path/to/your/octopress/repo/source/_layouts
</code></pre>

<h3>Add feedzirra dependency to the Octopress Gemfile</h3>

<p>Octopress wants its dependencies bundled, so you will want to add this dependency to /path/to/your/octopress/repo/Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'feedzirra', '~&gt; 0.1.3'
</code></pre>

<p>Then update the bundles:</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle update
</code></pre>

<h3>Create a page for your feed aggregator</h3>

<p>Here is an example feed aggregator:</p>

<pre><code>---
# use the 'feed_aggregator' layout to generate a feed aggregator page
layout: feed_aggregator

# Title to display for the feed
title: My Blog Feed Aggregator

# maximum number of entries from each feed url to display (defaults to 5)
# use '0' for 'no limit'
post_limit: 5

# limit on total posts for feed (defaults to 100)
# use 0 for 'no limit'
post_total_limit: 50

# maximum post age to include: &lt;N&gt; { seconds | minutes | hours | days | weeks | months | years }
# abbreviations and plurals are supported, e.g.  w, week, weeks
# defaults to '1 year'
# use '0 &lt;any-unit&gt;' for 'no limit'
post_age_limit: 6 months

# only render full content for the first &lt;N&gt; posts 
# (default is 'full content for all posts')
# use a limit of 0 to use all summaries
full_post_limit: 10

# use summaries for all posts older than this 
# (default is 'no maximum age')
# works like post_age_limit
full_post_age_limit: 1 month

# generate a 'meta-feed' atom file, with the given name 'atom.xml' (meta feeds are optional)
# (with no directory, generates in same directory as the feed aggregator page)
meta_feed: atom.xml

# list all urls to aggregate here
# You can either specify a single feed url, or explicitly specify 'url', 'author' 
# and/or 'author_url' params for the feed aggregator to use.
# feed_aggregator does its best to supply these values automatically otherwise.
feed_list:
  - http://blog_site_1.com/atom.xml
  - http://blog_site_2.com/atom.xml
  - url: http://www.john_doe.com/feed/feed.rss
    author: John Doe
    author_url: http://www.john_doe.com
---
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, you only need to supply some yaml front-matter.  Page formatting/rendering is performed automatically from the information in the header.  You must use <code>layout: feed_aggregator</code>, and include the standard <code>title</code> to use for the aggregator title, and the <code>feed_list</code> to supply the individual feeds to aggregate.  Other parameters have default values and behaviors, which are described above.  Various <code>meta_feed</code> path behaviors are described in their own section below.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve created the page, you can publish as usual:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake generate
$ rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to update your feed automatically, you can set up a cron job:</p>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/octopress/repo
rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<h3>Screen Shot</h3>

<p>Here is a screen shot of a feed aggregator.  It respects whatever style theme is configured for the site.  The aggregator title is at the top, and a list of contributing authors is automatically generated as an &#8216;aside&#8217;.  Each author name links to the parent blog of the author&#8217;s feed.  In addition to the standard date, the author&#8217;s name is also included.  Post titles link back to the original post url.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/feed_aggregator/screen1.png" alt="Aggregator Screen Shot" /></p>

<h3>Meta feed generation</h3>

<p>You may optionally request that a meta feed, created from the aggregated posts, be generated.  The meta feed is created in atom format.  Following are some examples of specifying meta feed files</p>

<pre><code># Generate a meta feed called 'atom.xml' in the same directory as the feed aggregator page
# e.g. if the url for the feed aggregator page is  http://blog.site.com/aggregator/index.html, 
# then the path to the meta-feed will be: http://blog.site.com/aggregator/atom.xml
meta_feed: atom.xml

# Generate a meta feed called 'wilma.xml' in subdirectory 'flintstones' of the website.
# the url for this file will be:   http://blog.site.com/flintstones/wilma.xml
meta_feed: /flintstones/wilma.xml

# url for this will be http://blog.site.com/metafeed.xml
meta_feed: /metafeed.xml

# Supplying no file name is equivalent to 'meta_feed: atom.xml'
meta_feed:
</code></pre>

<h3>To Do</h3>

<ul>
<li>It might be nice to support the display of an avatar/icon for authors</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Condor maintains certain key transactional information using the ClassAd Log system.  For example, both the negotiator&#8217;s accountant log (&#8220;Accountantnew.log&#8221;) and the scheduler&#8217;s job queue log (&#8220;job_queue.log&#8221;) are maintained in ClassAd Log format.</p>

<p>As of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/mrg/grid/">Red Hat Grid 2.2</a> (upstream: <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">condor 7.9.0</a>), the ClassAd Log system provides significantly improved parse checking.  This upgraded format checking allows a much wider variety of log corruptions to be detected, and also provides detailed information on the location of corruptions encountered.</p>

<h3>ClassAd Log Format</h3>

<p>A bit of familiarity with ClassAd Log format will aid in understanding subsequent discussion.  The ClassAd Log system serializes a ClassAd collection history as a sequence of tuples:  <code>opcode, [key, [args]]</code>.  For example, here is an annotated ClassAd log excerpt (NOTE: annotations or comments are illegal in an actual file):</p>

<pre><code>105                               &lt;- open a transaction
103 1.0 LastSuspensionTime 0      &lt;- for classad '1.0', set LastSuspentionTime to 0
103 1.0 CurrentHosts 1            &lt;- for classad '1.0', set CurrentHosts to 1
106                               &lt;- close the transaction
</code></pre>

<p>ClassAd Log parse checking works by detecting any occurrence of an invalid op-code, or any invalid ClassAd expression in the RHS of an attribute update operation (opcode 103, as in the example above)</p>

<h3>Examples of Parse Failure Detection</h3>

<p>Consider a ClassAd Log with a corrupted op-code &#8216;ZMG&#8217; (in this case, not even a proper integer):</p>

<pre><code>107 1 CreationTimestamp 1334245749
101 0.0 Job Machine
103 0.0 NextClusterNum 1
105
ZMG 1.0 JobStatus 2                        &lt;- Oh no, a bad opcode!
103 1.0 EnteredCurrentStatus 1334245771
103 1.0 LastSuspensionTime 0
103 1.0 CurrentHosts 1
106
105
103 1.1 LastJobStatus 1
103 1.1 JobStatus 2
</code></pre>

<p>Parse checking will result in the following log message in the scheduler, which provides its assessment of what operation line/tuple it found the corruption, and the following 3 lines for additional context:</p>

<pre><code>09/12/12 15:30:35 WARNING: Encountered corrupt log record 5 (byte offset 89)
09/12/12 15:30:35 Lines following corrupt log record 5 (up to 3):
09/12/12 15:30:35     103 1.0 EnteredCurrentStatus 1334245771
09/12/12 15:30:35     103 1.0 LastSuspensionTime 0
09/12/12 15:30:35     103 1.0 CurrentHosts 1
09/12/12 15:30:35 ERROR "Error: corrupt log record 5 (byte offset 89) occurred inside closed transaction, recovery failed" at line 1136 in file /home/eje/git/grid/src/condor_utils/classad_log.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>Note that here the scheduler halted with an exception, as strict parsing was enabled, and the error was inside a completed transaction.</p>

<p>Here is a second example that contains a badly-formed ClassAd expression:</p>

<pre><code>107 1 CreationTimestamp 1334245749
101 0.0 Job Machine
103 0.0 NextClusterNum 1
105
103 1.0 JobStatus 2
103 1.0 EnteredCurrentStatus 1334245749
103 1.0 LastSuspensionTime 0
103 1.0 CurrentHosts 1
106
105
103 1.1 LastJobStatus 1 + eek!             &lt;- bad ClassAd expr!
103 1.1 JobStatus 2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that parse errors detected in unterminated transactions (the last transaction in a file may be uncompleted) are considered non-fatal:</p>

<pre><code>09/12/12 15:43:29 WARNING: Encountered corrupt log record 11 (byte offset 211)
09/12/12 15:43:29 Lines following corrupt log record 11 (up to 3):
09/12/12 15:43:29     103 1.1 JobStatus 2
09/12/12 15:43:29 Detected unterminated log entry in ClassAd Log /home/eje/condor/local/spool/job_queue.log. Forcing rotation.
</code></pre>

<h3>Disabling Strict Parse Checking</h3>

<p>Strict parse checking means that detected errors are fatal (unless in an unterminated transaction).  One consequence of the former lax error checking for Classad Log files is that some log file output was generated that was not properly formed.  Most such instances have been identified and corrected.  However, in order to accomodate legacy ClassAd Log files and any hidden bugs in log output generation, a condor configuration variable has been provided to disable strict checking:</p>

<pre><code># Disable strict parsing: parse errors will not be fatal
CLASSAD_LOG_STRICT_PARSING = False
</code></pre>

<p>In Red Hat Grid 2.2, <code>CLASSAD_LOG_STRICT_PARSING</code> defaults to <code>False</code>.  In the upstream condor repository, the default value has been set to <code>True</code>, in order to allow strict parsing failures to capture any remaining infrequent bugs in ClassAd log generation.</p>

<p>Note that strict checking can also be disabled or enabled <em>selectively</em>.  For example, this configuration disables strict checking only on the negotiator:</p>

<pre><code>CLASSAD_LOG_STRICT_PARSING = True
NEGOTIATOR.CLASSAD_LOG_STRICT_PARSING = False
</code></pre>

<h3>Categories of Undetectable Corruption</h3>

<p>In the ClassAd Log format, the key is considered an arbitrary string.  Therefore, any corruption that alters a key value is not detectable:</p>

<pre><code>103 1.rats! LastSuspensionTime 0   &lt;- weird key '1.rats!' will go undetected
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, ClassAd attribute names are by nature arbitrary, and so corruptions to a name can go undetected:</p>

<pre><code>103 1.0 LastOopsie 0   &lt;- LastOopsie is a valid attribute name
</code></pre>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Condor can run its jobs with a renice priority level specified by <code>JOB_RENICE_INCREMENT</code>, which defaults simply to 10, but can in fact be any ClassAd expression, and is evaluated in the context of the job ad corresponding to the job being run.</p>

<p>This opens up an opportunity to create a renice <em>policy</em>, driven by accounting groups.  Consider a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/07/10/configuring-minimum-and-maximum-resources-for-mission-critical-jobs-in-a-condor-pool/">scenario I discussed previously</a>, where a condor pool caters to mission critical (MC) jobs and regular (R) jobs.</p>

<p>An additional configuration trick we could apply is to add a renice policy that gives a higher renice value (that is, a lower priority) to any jobs that aren&#8217;t run under the mission-critical (MC) rubric, as in this example configuration:</p>

<pre><code># A convenience expression that extracts group, e.g. "mc.user@domain.com" --&gt; "mc"
SUBMIT_EXPRS = AcctGroupName
AcctGroupName = ifThenElse(my.AccountingGroup =!= undefined, \
                           regexps("^([^@]+)\.[^.]+", my.AccountingGroup, "\1"), "&lt;none&gt;")

NUM_CPUS = 3

# Groups representing mission critical and regular jobs:
GROUP_NAMES = MC, R
GROUP_QUOTA_MC = 2
GROUP_QUOTA_R = 1

# Any group not MC gets a renice increment of 10:
JOB_RENICE_INCREMENT = 10 * (AcctGroupName =!= "MC")
</code></pre>

<p>To demonstrate this policy in action, I wrote a little shell script I called <code>burn</code>, whose only function is to burn cycles for a given number of seconds:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# usage: burn [n]
# where n is number of seconds to burn cycles
s="$1"
if [ -z "$s" ]; then s=60; fi

t0=`date +%s`
while [ 1 ]; do
    x=0
    # burn some cycles:
    while [ $x -lt 10000 ]; do let x=$x+1; done
    t=`date +%s`
    let e=$t-$t0
    # halt when the requested time is up:
    if [ $e -gt $s ]; then exit ; fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>Begin by standing up a condor pool including the configuration above.   Make sure the <code>burn</code> script is readable.  Also, it is preferable to make sure your system is unloaded (load average should be as close to zero as reasonably possible).  Then submit the following, which instantiates two <code>burn</code> jobs running under accounting group <code>MC</code> and a third under group <code>R</code>:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /path/to/burn
args = 600
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
+AccountingGroup = "MC.user"
queue 2
+AccountingGroup = "R.user"
queue 1
</code></pre>

<p>Allow the jobs to negotiate and then run for a couple minutes.  You should then see something similar to the following load-average information from the slot ads:</p>

<pre><code>$ condor_status -format "%s" SlotID -format " | %.2f" LoadAvg -format " | %.2f" CondorLoadAvg -format " | %.2f" TotalLoadAvg -format " | %.2f" TotalCondorLoadAvg -format " | %s\n" AccountingGroup | sort
1 | 1.33 | 1.33 | 2.75 | 2.70 | MC.user@localdomain
2 | 1.28 | 1.24 | 2.75 | 2.70 | MC.user@localdomain
3 | 0.13 | 0.13 | 2.77 | 2.72 | R.user@localdomain
</code></pre>

<p>Note, which particular <code>SlotID</code> runs which job may vary.  However, we expect to see that the load averages for the slot running group <code>R</code> are much lower than the load averages for slots running jobs under group <code>MC</code>, as seen above.</p>

<p>We can explicitly verify the renice numbers from our policy to see that our one <code>R</code> job has a nice value of 10 (and is using only a fraction of the cpu):</p>

<pre><code># tell 'ps' to give us (pid, %cpu, nice, cmd+args):
$ ps -eo "%p %C %n %a" | grep 'burn 600'
22403 10.2  10 /bin/sh /home/eje/bin/burn 600
22406 93.2   0 /bin/sh /home/eje/bin/burn 600
22411 90.6   0 /bin/sh /home/eje/bin/burn 600
</code></pre>
