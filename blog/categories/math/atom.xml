    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When training a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision tree</a> learning model (or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">ensemble</a> of such models) it is often nice to have a policy for deciding when a tree node can no longer be usefully split.  There are a variety possibilities.  For example, halting when node population size becomes smaller than some threshold is a simple and effective policy.  Another approach is to halt when some measure of node purity fails to increase by some minimum threshold.  <strong>The underlying concept is to have some measure of split <em>quality</em>, and to halt when no candidate split has sufficient quality.</strong></p>

<p>In this post I am going to discuss some advantages to one of my favorite approaches to measuring split quality, which is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">test statistic significance</a> -- aka "p-value" -- of the null hypothesis that the left and right sub-populations are the same after the split.  The idea is that if a split is of good quality, then it ought to have caused the sub-populations to the left and right of the split to be <em>meaningfully different</em>.  That is to say: the null hypothesis (that they are the same) should be <em>rejected</em> with high confidence, i.e. a small p-value.  What constitutes "small" is always context dependent, but popular p-values from applied statistics are 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, etc.</p>

<p>The remainder of this post is organized in the following sections:</p>

<p><a href="#consistency">Consistency</a> <br>
<a href="#awareness">Awareness of Sample Sizes</a> <br>
<a href="#results">Training Results</a> <br>
<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a> <br></p>

<p><a name="consistency"></a></p>

<h5>Consistency</h5>

<p>Test statistic p-values have some appealing properties as a split quality measure.  The test statistic methodology has the advantage of working essentially the same way regardless of the particular test being used.  We begin with two sample populations; in our case, these are the left and right sub-populations created by a candidate split.  We want to assess whether these two populations have the same distribution (the null hypothesis) or different distributions.  We measure some test statistic 'S' (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">Student's t</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test#Example_chi-squared_test_for_categorical_data">Chi-Squared</a>, etc).  We then compute the probability that |S| >= the value we actually measured.  This probability is commonly referred to as the p-value.  The smaller the p-value, the less likely it is that our two populations are the same.  <strong>In our case, we can interpret this as: a smaller p-value indicates a better quality split.</strong></p>

<p>This consistent methodology has a couple advantages contributing to user experience (UX).  If all measures of split quality work in the same way, then there is a lower cognitive load to move between measures once the user understands the common pattern of use.  A second advantage is better "unit analysis."  Since all such quality measures take the form of p-values, there is no risk of a chosen quality measure getting mis-aligned with a corresponding quality threshold.  They are all probabilities, on the interval [0,1], and "smaller threshold" always means "higher threshold of split quality."   By way of comparison, if an application is measuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29">entropy</a> and then switches to using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity">Gini impurity</a>, these measures are in differing units and care has to be taken that the correct quality threshold is used in each case or the model training policy will be broken.  Switching between differing statistical tests does not come with the same risk.  <strong>A p-value quality threshold will have the same semantic regardless of which statistical test is being applied:</strong> probability that left and right sub-populations are the same, given the particular statistic being measured.</p>

<p><a name="awareness"></a></p>

<h5>Awareness of Sample Size</h5>

<p>Test statistics have another appealing property: many are "aware" of sample size in a way that captures the idea that the smaller the sample size, the larger the difference between populations should be to conclude a given significance.  For one example, consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch's_t-test#Statistical_test">Welch's t-test</a>, the two-sample variation of the t distribution that applies well to comparing left and right sub populations of candidate decision tree splits:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pval_halting/figure_1.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Visualizing the effects of sample sizes n1 and n2 on these equations directly is a bit tricky, but assuming equal sample sizes and variances allows the equations to be simplified quite a bit, so that we can observe the effect of sample size:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pval_halting/figure_2.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>These simplified equations show clearly that (all else remaining equal) as sample size grows smaller, the measured t-statistic correspondingly grows smaller (proportional to sqrt(n)), and furthermore the corresponding variance of the t distribution to be applied grows larger.  For any given shift in left and right sub-populations, each of these trends yields a larger (i.e. weaker) p-value.   This behavior is desirable for a split quality metric.  <strong>The less data there is at a given candidate split, the less confidence there <em>should</em> be in split quality.</strong>  Put another way: we would like to require a larger difference before a split is measured as being good quality when we have less data to work with, and that is exactly the behavior the t-test provides us.</p>

<p><a name="results"></a></p>

<h5>Training Results</h5>

<p>These propreties are pleasing, but it remains to show that test statistics can actually improve decision tree training in practice.  In the following sections I will compare the effects of training with test statstics with other split quality policies based on entropy and gini index.</p>

<p>To conduct these experiments, I modified a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/pval_halting/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/tree/impurity/ChiSquared.scala">local copy</a> of Apache Spark with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test#Example_chi-squared_test_for_categorical_data">Chi-Squared</a> test statistic for comparing categorical distributions.  The demo script, which I ran in <code>spark-shell</code>, can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/pval_halting/pval_demo">here</a>.</p>

<p>I generated an example data set that represents a two-class learning problem, where labels may be 0 or 1.  Each sample has 10 clean binary features, such that if the bit is 1, the probability of the label is 90% 1 and 10% 0.  There are 5 noise features, also binary, which are completely random.   There are 50 samples of each clean feature being on, for a total of 500 samples.   There are also 500 samples where all clean features are 0 and the corresponding labels are 90% 0 and 10% 1.  The total number of samples in the data set is 1000.  The shape of the data is illustrated by the following table:</p>

<p><code>
truth |     features 0 - 9 (one on at a time)     |   random noise
------+-------------------------------------------+--------------
90% 1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 | 1   0   0   1   0
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 0 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 | 0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 | 0   1   1   0   0
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 1 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 2 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 3 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 4 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 5 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 6 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 7 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 8 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 1 |  ... 50 samples with feature 9 'on' ...   |   ... noise ...
90% 0 | 0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 | 1   1   0   0   1
90% 0 |  ... 500 samples with all 'off  ...       |   ... noise ...
</code></p>

<p>For the first run I use my customized chi-squared statistic as the split quality measure.  I used a p-value threshold of 0.01 -- that is, I would like my chi-squared test to conclude that the probability of left and right split populations are the same is &lt;= 0.01, or that split will not be used.  Note, this means I can expect that around 1% of the time, it will conclude a split was good, when it was just luck.  This is a reasonable false-positive rate; random forests are by nature robust to noise, including noise in their own split decisions:</p>

<p>scala>
```</p>

<p>The first thing to observe is that <strong>the resulting decision tree used exactly the 10 clean features 0 through 9, and none of the five noise features.</strong>   The tree splits off each of the clean features to obtain an optimally accurate leaf-node (one with 90% 1s and 10% 0s).  A second observation is that the p-values shown in the demo output are extremely small (i.e. strong) values -- around 1e-9 (one part in a billion) -- for good-quality splits.  We can also see "weak" p-values with magnitudes such as 0.7, 0.2, etc.  These are poor quality splits on the noise features that it rejects and does not use in the tree, exactly as we hope to see.</p>

<p>Next, I will show a similar run with the standard available "entropy" quality measure, and a minimum gain threshold of 0.035, which is a value I had to determine by trial and error, as what kind of entropy gains one can expect to see, and where to cut them off, is somewhat unintuitive and likely to be very data dependent.</p>

<p>The first observation is that <strong>the resulting tree using entropy as a split quality measure is twice the size of the tree trained using the chi-squared policy.</strong>  Worse, it is using the noise features -- its quality measure is yielding many more false positives.  The entropy-based model is less parsimonious and will also have performance problems since the model has included very noisy features.</p>

<p>Lastly, I ran a similar training using the "gini" impurity measure, and a 0.015 quality threshold (again, hopefully optimal value that I had to run multiple experiments to identify).  Its quality is better than the entropy-based measure, but this model is still substantially larger than the chi-squared model, and it still uses some noise features:</p>

    <updated>2016-03-26T16:22:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/03/26/computing-simplex-vertex-locations-from-pairwise-vertex-distances</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suppose I have a collection of (N) objects, and distances d(j,k) between each pair of objects (j) and (k); that is, my objects are members of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space">metric space</a>.  I have no knowledge about my objects, beyond these pair-wise distances.  These objects could be construed as vertices in an (N-1) dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">simplex</a>.  However, since I have no spatial information about my objects, I first need a way to assign spatial locations to each object, in vector space R<sup>(N-1),</sup> with only my object distances to work with.</p>

<p>In this post I will derive an algorithm for assigning vertex locations in R<sup>(N-1)</sup> for each of N objects, using only pairwise object distances.</p>

<p>I will assume that N >= 2, since at least two object are required to define a pairwise distance.  The case N=2 is easy, as I can assign vertex 1 to the origin, and vertex 2 to the point d(1,2), to form a 1-simplex (i.e. a line segment) whose single edge is just the distance between the two objects.  I will also assume that my N objects are distinct; that is, each pair has a non-zero distance.</p>

<p>Next consider an arbitrary N, and suppose I have already added vertices 1 through k.  The next vertex (k+1) must obey the pairwise distance relations, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/jm56vxq.png" alt="figure 1" /></p>

<p>Adding the new vertex (k+1) involves adding another dimension (k) to the simplex.  I define this new kth coordinate x(k) to be zero for the existing k vertices, as annotated above; only the new vertex (k+1) will have a non-zero kth coordinate.  Expanding the quadratic terms on the left yields the following form:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/jtm7dpq.png" alt="figure 2" /></p>

<p>The squared terms for the coordinates of the new vertex (k+1) are inconvenient, however I can get rid of them by subtracting pairs of equations above.  For example, if I subtract equation 1 from the remaining k-1 equations (2 through k), these squared terms disappear, leaving me with the following system of k-1 equations, which we can see is linear in the 1st k-1 coordinates of the new vertex.  Therefore, I know I'll be able to solve for those coordinates.  I can solve for the remaining kth coordinate by plugging it into the first distance equation:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/haovm32.png" alt="figure 3" /></p>

<p>To clarify matters, the equations above can be re-written as the following matrix equation, solveable by any linear systems library:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/h6qdtms.png" alt="figure 4" /></p>

<p>This gives me a recusion relation for adding a new vertex (k+1), given that I have already added the first k vertices.  The basis case of adding the first two vertices was already described above.  And so I can iteratively add all my vertices one at a time by applying the recursion relation.</p>

<p>As a corollary, assume that I have constructed a simplex having k vertices, as shown above, and I would like to assign a spatial location to a new object, (y), given its k distances to each vertex.  The corresponding distance relations are given by:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/zdw9uv8.png" alt="figure 5" /></p>

<p>I can apply a derivation very similar to the one above, to obtain the following linear equation for the (k-1) coordinates of (y):</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will demonstrate how to do reservoir sampling orders of magnitude faster than the traditional "naive" reservoir sampling algorithm, using a fast high-fidelity approximation to the reservoir sampling-gap distribution.</p>

<blockquote><p>The code I used to collect the data for this post can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/reservoir/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/sample/reservoir/reservoir.scala">here</a>.  I generated the plots using the <a href="https://github.com/quantifind/wisp">quantifind WISP</a> project.</p>

<p>Update (April 4, 2016): my colleague <a href="http://rnowling.github.io/">RJ Nowling</a> ran across a <a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit87.RandomSampling.pdf">paper by J.S. Vitter</a> that shows Vitter developed the trick of accelerating sampling with a sampling-gap distribution in 1987 -- I re-invented Vitter's wheel 30 years after the fact!  I'm surprised it never caught on, as it is not much harder to implement than the naive version.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> for the corresponding sampling distributions.  More recently, I also began exploring whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">reservoir sampling</a> might also be optimized using the gap sampling technique, by deriving the <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">reservoir sampling gap distribution</a>.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it presupposes that you can actually draw values from that distribution substantially faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.  I was unable to come up with a "direct" algorithm for drawing samples from P(k) above (I suspect none exists), however I also know the CDF F(k), so it <em>is</em> possible to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inversion sampling</a>, which runs in logarithmic time w.r.t the desired accuracy.  Although its logarithmic cost effectively guarantees that it will be a net efficiency win for sufficiently large (j), it still involves a substantial number of computations to yield its samples, and it seems unlikely to be competitive with straight "naive" reservoir sampling over many real-world data sizes, where (j) may never grow very large.</p>

<p>Well, if exact computations are too expensive, we can always look for a fast approximation.  Consider the original "first principles" formula for the sampling gap P(k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>As the figure above alludes to, if (j) is relatively large compared to (k), then values (j+1),(j+2)...(j+k) are all going to be effectively "close" to (j), and so we can replace them all with (j) as an approximation.  Note that the resulting approximation is just the PMF of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a>, with probability of success p=(R/j), and we already saw how to efficiently draw values from a geometric distribution from our experience with Bernoulli sampling.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to hope that this approximation will be useful?  For reasons that are similar to those for Bernoulli gap sampling, it will only be efficient to employ gap sampling when the probability (R/j) becomes small enough.  From our experiences with Bernoulli sampling that is <em>at least</em> j>=2R.  So, we have some assurance that (j) itself will be never be <em>very</em> small.  What about (k)?  Note that a geometric distribution "favors" smaller values of (k) -- that is, small values of (k) have the highest probabilities.  In fact, the smaller that (j) is, the larger the probability (R/j) is, and so the more likely that (k) values that are small relative to (j) will be the frequent ones.  It is also promising that the true distribution for P(k) <em>also</em> favors smaller values of (k) (in fact it favors them even a bit more strongly than the approximation).</p>

<p>Although it is encouraging, it is also clear that my argument above is limited to heuristic hand-waving.  What does this approximation really <em>look</em> like, compared to the true distribution?  Fortunately, it is easy to plot both distributions numerically, since we now know the formulas for both:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/CDFs_R=10.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>The plot above shows that, in fact, the geometric approximation is a <em>surprisingly good</em> approximation to the true distribution!  Furthermore, the approximation remains good as both (j) and (k) grow larger.</p>

<p>Our numeric eye-balling looks quite promising.  Is there an effective way to <em>measure</em> how good this approximation is?  One useful measure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic</a>, which is just the maximum absolute error between two cumulative distributions.  Here is a plot of the D statistic for reservoir size R=10, as (j) varies across several magnitudes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=10.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This plot is also good news: we can see that deviation, as measured by D, remains bounded at a small value (less than 0.0262).  As this is for the specific value R=10, we also want to know how things change as reservoir size changes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=all.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p>The news is still good!  As reservoir size grows, the approximation only gets better: the D values get smaller as R increases, and remain asymptotically bounded as (j) increases.</p>

<p>Now we have some numeric assurance that the geometric approximation is a good one, and stays good as reservoir size grows and sampling runs get longer.  However, we should also verify that an actual implementation of the approximation works as expected.</p>

<p>Here is pseudocode for an implementation of reservoir sampling using the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<pre><code>// data is array to sample from
// R is the reservoir size
function reservoirFast(data: Array, R: Int) {
  n = data.length
  // Initialize reservoir with first R elements of data:
  res = data[0 until R]
  // Until this threshold, use traditional sampling.  This value may
  // depend on performance characteristics of random number generation and/or
  // numeric libraries:
  t = 4 * R
  j = 1 + R
  while (j &lt; n  &amp;&amp;  j &lt;= t) {
    k = randomInt(j) // random integer &gt;= 0 and &lt; j
    if (k &lt; R) res[k] = data[j]
    j = j + 1
  }
  // Once gaps become significant, it pays to do gap sampling
  while (j &lt; n) {
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = R/j
    p = R / j
    u = randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1
    g = floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    j = j + g
    if (j &lt; n) {
      k = randomInt(R)
      res[k] = data[j]
    }
    j = j + 1
  }
  // return the reservoir
  return res
}
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a plot that shows two-sample D statistics, comparing the distribution in sample gaps between runs of the exact "naive" reservoir sampling with the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/D_naive_vs_fast.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>As expected, the measured difference in sampling characteristics between naive and fast approximation are small, confirming the numeric predictions.</p>

<p>Since the point of this exercise was to achieve faster random sampling, it remains to measure what kind of speed improvements the fast approximation provides.  As a point of reference, here is a plot of run times for reservoir sampling over 10<sup>8</sup> integers:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/naive_sample_time_vs_R.png" title="Figure 7" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<p>As expected, sample time remains constant at around 1.5 seconds, regardless of reservoir size, since the naive algorithm always samples from its RNG per each sample.</p>

<p>Compare this to the corresponding plot for the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sample_times_vs_R.png" title="Figure 8" alt="Figure 8" /></p>

<p>Firstly, we see that the sampling times are <em>much faster</em>, as originally anticipated in my <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">previous post</a> -- in the neighborhood of 3 orders of magnitude faster.  Secondly, we see that the sampling times do increase as a linear function of reservoir size.  Based on our experience with Bernoulli gap sampling, this is expected; the sampling probabilities are given by (R/j), and therefore the amount of sampling is proportional to R.</p>

<p>Another property anticipated in my previous post was that the efficiency of gap sampling should continue to increase as the amount of data sampled grows; the sampling probability being (R/j), the probability of sampling decreases as j gets larger, and so the corresponding gap sizes grow.  The following plot verifies this property, holding reservoir size R constant, and increasing the data size:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sampling_efficiency.png" title="Figure 9" alt="Figure 9" /></p>

<p>The sampling time (per million elements) decreases as the sample size grows, as predicted by the formula.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have demonstrated that a geometric distribution can be used as a high quality approximation to the true sampling gap distribution for reservoir sampling, which allows reservoir sampling to be performed much faster than the naive algorithm while still retaining sampling quality.</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> - that is, directly drawing random samples from the distribution of how many elements would be skipped over between actual samples taken.</p>

<p>Another popular sampling algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">Reservoir Sampling</a>.  Its sampling logic is a bit more complicated than Bernoulli or Poisson sampling, in the sense that the probability of sampling any given (jth) element <em>changes</em>. For a sampling reservoir of size R, and all j>R, the probability of choosing element (j) is R/j.  You can see that the potential payoff for gap-sampling is big, particularly as data size becomes large; as (j) approaches infinity, the probability R/j goes to zero, and the corresponding gaps between samples grow without bound.</p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it requires that (1) you actually <em>know</em> the sampling distribution, and (2) that you can effectively draw values from that distribution faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.</p>

<p>With that goal in mind, I derived the probability mass function (pmf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the sampling gap distribution of reservoir sampling.  In this post I will show the derivations.</p>

<h3>The Sampling Gap Distribution</h3>

<p>In the interest of making it easy to get at the actual answers, here are the pmf and cdf for the Reservoir Sampling Gap Distribution.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>In the derivations that follow, I will keep to some conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>R = the sampling reservoir size.  R > 0.</li>
<li>j = the index of a data element being considered for sampling.  j > R.</li>
<li>k = the size of a gap between samples.  k >= 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>P(k) is the probability that the gap between one sample and the next is of size k.  The support for P(k) is over all k>=0.  I will generally assume that j>R, as the first R samples are always loaded into the reservoir and the actual random sampling logic starts at j=R+1.  The constraint j>R will also be relevant to many binomial coefficient expressions, where it ensures the coefficient is well defined.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Probability Mass Function, P(k)</h3>

<p>Suppose we just chose (randomly) to sample data element (j-1).  Now we are interested in the probability distribution of the next sampling gap.  That is, the probability P(k) that we will <em>not</em> sample the next (k) elements {j,j+1,...j+k-1}, and sample element (j+k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure1.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>By arranging the product terms in descending order as above, you can see that they can be written as factorial quotients:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Now we apply <a href="#LemmaA">Lemma A</a>.  The 2nd case (a&lt;=b) of the Lemma applies, since (j-1-R)&lt;=j, so we have:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure3.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>And so we have now derived a compact, closed-form expression for P(k).</p>

<h3>Deriving the Cumulative Distribution Function, F(k)</h3>

<p>Now that we have a derivation for the pmf P(k), we can tackle a derivation for the cdf.  First I will make note of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Series_involving_binomial_coefficients">useful identity</a> that I scraped off of Wikipedia (I substituted (x) => (a) and (k) => (b)):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/identity1.png" title="identity 1" alt="identity 1" /></p>

<p>The cumulative distribution function for the sampling gap, F(k), is of course just the sum over P(t), for (t) from 0 up to (k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure4.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This is a closed-form solution, but we can apply a bit more simplification:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure5.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>We have derived closed-form expressions for the pmf and cdf of the Reservoir Sampling gap distribution:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>In order to apply these results to a practical gap-sampling implementation of Reservoir Sampling, we would next need a way to efficiently sample from P(k), to obtain gap sizes to skip over.  How to accomplish this is an open question, but knowing a formula for P(k) and F(k) is a start.</p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/14/generalizing-kendalls-tau/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-14T14:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/14/generalizing-kendalls-tau</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have been applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient">Kendall's Tau</a> as an evaluation metric to assess how well a regression model ranks input samples, with respect to a known correct ranking.</p>

<p>The process of implementing the Kendall's Tau statistic, with my software engineer's hat on, caused me to reflect a bit on how it could be generalized beyond the traditional application of ranking numeric pairs.  In this post I'll discuss the generalization of Kendall's Tau to non-numeric data, and also generalizing from totally ordered data to partial orderings.</p>

<h5>A Review of Kendall's Tau</h5>

<p>I'll start with a brief review of Kendall's Tau.  For more depth, a good place to start is the Wikipedia article at the link above.</p>

<p>Consider a sequence of (n) observations where each observation is a pair (x,y), where we wish to measure how well a ranking by x-values agrees with a ranking by the y-values.  Informally, Kendall's Tau (aka the Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient) is the difference between number of observation-pairs (pairs of pairs, if you will) whose ordering <em>agrees</em> ("concordant" pairs) and the number of such pairs whose ordering <em>disagrees</em> ("discordant" pairs).  This difference is divided by the total number of observation pairs.</p>

<p>The commonly-used formulation of Kendall's Tau is the "Tau-B" statistic, which accounts for observed pairs having tied values in either x or y as being neither concordant nor discordant:</p>

<h6>Figure 1: Kendall's Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_1.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The formulation above has quadratic complexity, with respect to data size (n).  It is possible to rearrange this computation in a way that can be computed in (n)log(n) time[1]:</p>

<h6>Figure 2: An (n)log(n) formulation of Kendall's Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_2.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The details of performing this computation can be found at [1] or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient#Algorithms">Wikipedia entry</a>.  For my purposes, I'll note that it requires two (n)log(n) sorts of the data, which becomes relevant below.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Non-Numeric Values</h5>

<p>Generalizing Kendall's Tau to non-numeric values is mostly just making the observation that the definition of "concordant" and "discordant" pairs is purely based on comparing x-values and y-values (and, in the (n)log(n) formulation, performing sorts on the data).  From the software engineer's perspective this means that the computations are well defined on any data type with an ordering relation, which includes numeric types but also chars, strings, sequences of any element supporting an ordering, etc.  Significantly, most programming languages support the concept of defining ordering relations on arbitrary data types, which means that <em><em>Kendall's Tau can, in principle, be computed on literally any kind of data structure</em></em>, provided you supply it with a well defined ordering.  Furthermore, an examination of the algorithms shows that values of x and y need not even be of the same type, nor do they require the same ordering.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Partial Orderings</h5>

<p>When I brought this observation up, my colleague <a href="http://chapeau.freevariable.com/">Will Benton</a> asked the very interesting question of whether it's also possible to compute Kendall's Tau on objects that have only a <em>partial ordering</em>.  It turns out that you <em><em>can</em></em> define Kendall's Tau on partially ordered data, by defining the case of two non-comparable x-values, or y-values, as another kind of tie.</p>

<p>The big caveat with this definition is that the (n)log(n) optimization does not apply.  Firstly, the optimized algorithm relies heavily on (n)log(n) sorting, and there is no unique full sorting of elements that are only partially ordered.  Secondly, the formula's definition of the quantities n1, n2 and n3 is founded on the assumption that element equality is transitive; this is why you can count a number of tied values, t, and use t(t-1)/2 as the corresponding number of tied pairs.  But in a partial ordering, this assumption is violated. Consider the case where (a) &lt; (b), but (a) is non-comparable to (c) and (b) is also non-comparable to (c).  By our definition, (a) is tied with (c), and (c) is tied with (b), but transitivity is violated, as (a) &lt; (b).</p>

<p>So how <em>can</em> we compute Tau in this case?  Consider (n1) and (n2), in Figure-1.  These values represent the number of pairs that were tied wrt (x) and (y), respectively.  We can't use the shortcut formulas for (n1) and (n2), but we can count them directly, pair by pair, simply by conducting the traditional quadratic iteration over pairs, and incrementing (n1) whenever two x-values are noncomparable, and incrementing (n2) whenever two y-values are non-comparable, just as we increment (nc) and (nd) to count concordant and discordant pairs.  With this modification, we can apply the formula in Figure-1 as-is.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>I made these observations without any particular application in mind. However, my instincts as a software engineer tell me that making generalizations in this way often paves the way for new ideas, once the generalized concept is made available.  With luck, it will inspire either me or somebody else to apply Kendall's Tau in interesting new ways.</p>
