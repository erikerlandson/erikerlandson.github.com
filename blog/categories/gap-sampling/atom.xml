    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will demonstrate how to do reservoir sampling orders of magnitude faster than the traditional "naive" reservoir sampling algorithm, using a fast high-fidelity approximation to the reservoir sampling-gap distribution.</p>

<blockquote><p>The code I used to collect the data for this post can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/reservoir/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/sample/reservoir/reservoir.scala">here</a>.  I generated the plots using the <a href="https://github.com/quantifind/wisp">quantifind WISP</a> project.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> for the corresponding sampling distributions.  More recently, I also began exploring whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">reservoir sampling</a> might also be optimized using the gap sampling technique, by deriving the <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">reservoir sampling gap distribution</a>.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it presupposes that you can actually draw values from that distribution substantially faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.  I was unable to come up with a "direct" algorithm for drawing samples from P(k) above (I suspect none exists), however I also know the CDF F(k), so it <em>is</em> possible to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inversion sampling</a>, which runs in logarithmic time w.r.t the desired accuracy.  Although its logarithmic cost effectively guarantees that it will be a net efficiency win for sufficiently large (j), it still involves a substantial number of computations to yield its samples, and it seems unlikely to be competitive with straight "naive" reservoir sampling over many real-world data sizes, where (j) may never grow very large.</p>

<p>Well, if exact computations are too expensive, we can always look for a fast approximation.  Consider the original "first principles" formula for the sampling gap P(k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>As the figure above alludes to, if (j) is relatively large compared to (k), then values (j+1),(j+2)...(j+k) are all going to be effectively "close" to (j), and so we can replace them all with (j) as an approximation.  Note that the resulting approximation is just the PMF of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a>, with probability of success p=(R/j), and we already saw how to efficiently draw values from a geometric distribution from our experience with Bernoulli sampling.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to hope that this approximation will be useful?  For reasons that are similar to those for Bernoulli gap sampling, it will only be efficient to employ gap sampling when the probability (R/j) becomes small enough.  From our experiences with Bernoulli sampling that is <em>at least</em> j>=2R.  So, we have some assurance that (j) itself will be never be <em>very</em> small.  What about (k)?  Note that a geometric distribution "favors" smaller values of (k) -- that is, small values of (k) have the highest probabilities.  In fact, the smaller that (j) is, the larger the probability (R/j) is, and so the more likely that (k) values that are small relative to (j) will be the frequent ones.  It is also promising that the true distribution for P(k) <em>also</em> favors smaller values of (k) (in fact it favors them even a bit more strongly than the approximation).</p>

<p>Although it is encouraging, it is also clear that my argument above is limited to heuristic hand-waving.  What does this approximation really <em>look</em> like, compared to the true distribution?  Fortunately, it is easy to plot both distributions numerically, since we now know the formulas for both:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/CDFs_R=10.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>The plot above shows that, in fact, the geometric approximation is a <em>surprisingly good</em> approximation to the true distribution!  Furthermore, the approximation remains good as both (j) and (k) grow larger.</p>

<p>Our numeric eye-balling looks quite promising.  Is there an effective way to <em>measure</em> how good this approximation is?  One useful measure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic</a>, which is just the maximum absolute error between two cumulative distributions.  Here is a plot of the D statistic for reservoir size R=10, as (j) varies across several magnitudes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=10.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This plot is also good news: we can see that deviation, as measured by D, remains bounded at a small value (less than 0.0262).  As this is for the specific value R=10, we also want to know how things change as reservoir size changes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=all.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p>The news is still good!  As reservoir size grows, the approximation only gets better: the D values get smaller as R increases, and remain asymptotically bounded as (j) increases.</p>

<p>Now we have some numeric assurance that the geometric approximation is a good one, and stays good as reservoir size grows and sampling runs get longer.  However, we should also verify that an actual implementation of the approximation works as expected.</p>

<p>Here is pseudocode for an implementation of reservoir sampling using the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<pre><code>// data is array to sample from
// R is the reservoir size
function reservoirFast(data: Array, R: Int) {
  n = data.length
  // Initialize reservoir with first R elements of data:
  res = data[0 until R]
  // Until this threshold, use traditional sampling.  This value may
  // depend on performance characteristics of random number generation and/or
  // numeric libraries:
  t = 4 * R
  j = 1 + R
  while (j &lt; n  &amp;&amp;  j &lt;= t) {
    k = randomInt(j) // random integer &gt;= 0 and &lt; j
    if (k &lt; R) res[k] = data[j]
    j = j + 1
  }
  // Once gaps become significant, it pays to do gap sampling
  while (j &lt; n) {
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = R/j
    p = R / j
    u = randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1
    g = floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    j = j + g
    if (j &lt; n) {
      k = randomInt(R)
      res[k] = data[j]
    }
    j = j + 1
  }
  // return the reservoir
  return res
}
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a plot that shows two-sample D statistics, comparing the distribution in sample gaps between runs of the exact "naive" reservoir sampling with the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/D_naive_vs_fast.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>As expected, the measured difference in sampling characteristics between naive and fast approximation are small, confirming the numeric predictions.</p>

<p>Since the point of this exercise was to achieve faster random sampling, it remains to measure what kind of speed improvements the fast approximation provides.  As a point of reference, here is a plot of run times for reservoir sampling over 10<sup>8</sup> integers:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/naive_sample_time_vs_R.png" title="Figure 7" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<p>As expected, sample time remains constant at around 1.5 seconds, regardless of reservoir size, since the naive algorithm always samples from its RNG per each sample.</p>

<p>Compare this to the corresponding plot for the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sample_times_vs_R.png" title="Figure 8" alt="Figure 8" /></p>

<p>Firstly, we see that the sampling times are <em>much faster</em>, as originally anticipated in my <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">previous post</a> -- in the neighborhood of 3 orders of magnitude faster.  Secondly, we see that the sampling times do increase as a linear function of reservoir size.  Based on our experience with Bernoulli gap sampling, this is expected; the sampling probabilities are given by (R/j), and therefore the amount of sampling is proportional to R.</p>

<p>Another property anticipated in my previous post was that the efficiency of gap sampling should continue to increase as the amount of data sampled grows; the sampling probability being (R/j), the probability of sampling decreases as j gets larger, and so the corresponding gap sizes grow.  The following plot verifies this property, holding reservoir size R constant, and increasing the data size:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sampling_efficiency.png" title="Figure 9" alt="Figure 9" /></p>

<p>The sampling time (per million elements) decreases as the sample size grows, as predicted by the formula.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have demonstrated that a geometric distribution can be used as a high quality approximation to the true sampling gap distribution for reservoir sampling, which allows reservoir sampling to be performed much faster than the naive algorithm while still retaining sampling quality.</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> - that is, directly drawing random samples from the distribution of how many elements would be skipped over between actual samples taken.</p>

<p>Another popular sampling algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">Reservoir Sampling</a>.  Its sampling logic is a bit more complicated than Bernoulli or Poisson sampling, in the sense that the probability of sampling any given (jth) element <em>changes</em>. For a sampling reservoir of size R, and all j>R, the probability of choosing element (j) is R/j.  You can see that the potential payoff for gap-sampling is big, particularly as data size becomes large; as (j) approaches infinity, the probability R/j goes to zero, and the corresponding gaps between samples grow without bound.</p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it requires that (1) you actually <em>know</em> the sampling distribution, and (2) that you can effectively draw values from that distribution faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.</p>

<p>With that goal in mind, I derived the probability mass function (pmf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the sampling gap distribution of reservoir sampling.  In this post I will show the derivations.</p>

<h3>The Sampling Gap Distribution</h3>

<p>In the interest of making it easy to get at the actual answers, here are the pmf and cdf for the Reservoir Sampling Gap Distribution.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>In the derivations that follow, I will keep to some conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>R = the sampling reservoir size.  R > 0.</li>
<li>j = the index of a data element being considered for sampling.  j > R.</li>
<li>k = the size of a gap between samples.  k >= 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>P(k) is the probability that the gap between one sample and the next is of size k.  The support for P(k) is over all k>=0.  I will generally assume that j>R, as the first R samples are always loaded into the reservoir and the actual random sampling logic starts at j=R+1.  The constraint j>R will also be relevant to many binomial coefficient expressions, where it ensures the coefficient is well defined.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Probability Mass Function, P(k)</h3>

<p>Suppose we just chose (randomly) to sample data element (j-1).  Now we are interested in the probability distribution of the next sampling gap.  That is, the probability P(k) that we will <em>not</em> sample the next (k) elements {j,j+1,...j+k-1}, and sample element (j+k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure1.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>By arranging the product terms in descending order as above, you can see that they can be written as factorial quotients:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Now we apply <a href="#LemmaA">Lemma A</a>.  The 2nd case (a&lt;=b) of the Lemma applies, since (j-1-R)&lt;=j, so we have:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure3.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>And so we have now derived a compact, closed-form expression for P(k).</p>

<h3>Deriving the Cumulative Distribution Function, F(k)</h3>

<p>Now that we have a derivation for the pmf P(k), we can tackle a derivation for the cdf.  First I will make note of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Series_involving_binomial_coefficients">useful identity</a> that I scraped off of Wikipedia (I substituted (x) => (a) and (k) => (b)):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/identity1.png" title="identity 1" alt="identity 1" /></p>

<p>The cumulative distribution function for the sampling gap, F(k), is of course just the sum over P(t), for (t) from 0 up to (k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure4.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This is a closed-form solution, but we can apply a bit more simplification:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure5.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>We have derived closed-form expressions for the pmf and cdf of the Reservoir Sampling gap distribution:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>In order to apply these results to a practical gap-sampling implementation of Reservoir Sampling, we would next need a way to efficiently sample from P(k), to obtain gap sizes to skip over.  How to accomplish this is an open question, but knowing a formula for P(k) and F(k) is a start.</p>
