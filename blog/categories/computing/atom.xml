    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/09/05/expressing-map-reduce-as-a-left-folding-monoid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/11/24/the-prepare-operation-considered-harmful-in-algebird/">previous post</a> I discussed some scenarios where traditional map-reduce (directly applying a map function, followed by some monoidal reduction) could be inefficient.
To review, the source of inefficiency is in situations where the <code>map</code> operation is creating some non-trivial monoid that represents a single element of the input type.
For example, if the monoidal type is <code>Set[Int]</code>, then the mapping function ('prepare' in algebird) maps every input integer <code>k</code> into <code>Set(k)</code>, which is somewhat expensive.</p>

<p>In that discussion, I was focusing on map-reduce as embodied by the algebird <code>Aggregator</code> type, where <code>map</code> appears as the <code>prepare</code> function.
However, it is easy to see that <em>any</em> map-reduce implementation may be vulnerable to the same inefficiency.</p>

<p>I wondered if there were a way to represent map-reduce using some alternative formulation that avoids this vulnerability.
There is such a formulation, which I will talk about in this post.</p>

<p>I'll begin by reviewing a standard map-reduce implementation.
The following scala code sketches out the definition of a monoid over a type <code>B</code> and a map-reduce interface.
As this code suggests, the <code>map</code> function maps input data of some type <code>A</code> into some <em>monoidal</em> type <code>B</code>, which can be reduced (aka "aggregated") in a way that is amenable to parallelization:</p>

<p>``` scala
trait Monoid[B] {
  // aka 'combine' aka '++'
  def plus: (B, B) => B</p>

<p>  // aka 'empty' aka 'identity'
  def e: B
}</p>

<p>trait MapReduce[A, B] {
  // monoid embodies the reducible type
  def monoid: Monoid[B]</p>

<p>  // mapping function from input type A to reducible type B
  def map: A => B</p>

<p>  // the basic map-reduce operation
  def apply(data: Seq[A]): B = data.map(map).fold(monoid.e)(monoid.plus)</p>

<p>  // map-reduce parallelized over data partitions
  def apply(data: ParSeq[Seq[A]]): B =</p>

<pre><code>data.map { part =&gt;
  part.map(map).fold(monoid.e)(monoid.plus)
}
.fold(monoid.e)(monoid.plus)
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>In the parallel version of map-reduce above, you can see that map and reduce are executed on each data partition (which may occur in parallel) to produce a monoidal <code>B</code> value, followed by a final reduction of those intermediate results.
This is the classic form of map-reduce popularized by tools such as Hadoop and Apache Spark, where inidividual data partitions may reside across highly parallel commodity clusters.</p>

<p>Next I will present an alternative definition of map-reduce.
In this implementation, the <code>map</code> function is replaced by a <code>foldL</code> function, which executes a single "left-fold" of an input object with type <code>A</code> into the monoid object with type <code>B</code>:</p>

<p>``` scala
// a map reduce operation based on a monoid with left folding
trait MapReduceLF[A, B] extends MapReduce[A, B] {
  def monoid: Monoid[B]</p>

<p>  // left-fold an object with type A into the monoid B
  // obeys type law: foldL(b, a) = b ++ foldL(e, a)
  def foldL: (B, A) => B</p>

<p>  // foldL(e, a) embodies the role of map(a) in standard map-reduce
  def map = (a: A) => foldL(monoid.e, a)</p>

<p>  // map-reduce operation is now a single fold-left operation
  override def apply(data: Seq[A]): B = data.foldLeft(monoid.e)(foldL)</p>

<p>  // map-reduce parallelized over data partitions
  override def apply(data: ParSeq[Seq[A]]): B =</p>

<pre><code>data.map { part =&gt;
  part.foldLeft(monoid.e)(foldL)
}
.fold(monoid.e)(monoid.plus)
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>As the comments above indicate, the left-folding function <code>foldL</code> is assumed to obey the law <code>foldL(b, a) = b ++ foldL(e, a)</code>.
This law captures the idea that folding <code>a</code> into <code>b</code> should be the analog of reducing <code>b</code> with a monoid corresponding to the single element <code>a</code>.
Referring to my earlier example, if type <code>A</code> is <code>Int</code> and <code>B</code> is <code>Set[Int]</code>, then <code>foldL(b, a) =&gt; b + a</code>.
Note that <code>b + a</code> is directly inserting single element <code>a</code> into <code>b</code>, which is significantly more efficient than <code>b ++ Set(a)</code>, which is how a typical map-reduce implementation would be required to operate.</p>

<p>This law also gives us the corresponding definition of <code>map(a)</code>, which is <code>foldL(e, a)</code>, or in mhy example: <code>Set.empty[Int] ++ a</code> or just: <code>Set(a)</code></p>

<p>In this formulation, the basic map-reduce operation is now a single <code>foldLeft</code> operation, instead of a mapping followed by a monoidal reduction.
The parallel version is analoglous.
Each partition uses the new <code>foldLeft</code> operation, and the final reduction of intermediate monoidal results remains the same as before.</p>

<p>The <code>foldLeft</code> function is potentially a much more general operation, and it raises the question of whether this new encoding is indeed parallelizable as before.
I will conclude with a proof that this encoding is also parallelizable;
Note that the law <code>foldL(b, a) = b ++ foldL(e, a)</code> is a significant component of this proof, as it represents the constraint that <code>foldL</code> behaves like an analog of reducing <code>b</code> with a monoidal representation of element <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>In the following proof I used a scala-like pseudo code, described in the introduction:</p>

<p>```
// given an object mr of type MapReduceFL[A, B]
// and using notation:
// f &lt;==> mr.foldL
// for b1,b2 of type B: b1 ++ b2 &lt;==> mr.plus(b1, b2)
// e &lt;==> mr.e
// [...] &lt;==> Seq(...)
// d1, d2 are of type Seq[A]</p>

<p>// Proof that map-reduce with left-folding is parallelizable
// i.e. mr(d1 ++ d2) == mr(d1) ++ mr(d2)
mr(d1 ++ d2)
== (d1 ++ d2).foldLeft(e)(f)  // definition of map-reduce operation
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ d2.foldLeft(e)(f)  // Lemma A
== mr(d1) ++ mr(d2)  // definition of map-reduce (QED)</p>

<p>// Proof of Lemma A
// i.e. (d1 ++ d2).foldLeft(e)(f) == d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ d2.foldLeft(e)(f)</p>

<p>// proof is by induction on the length of data sequence d2</p>

<p>// case d2 where length is zero, i.e. d2 == []
(d1 ++ []).foldLeft(e)(f)
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f)  // definition of empty sequence []
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ e  // definition of identity e
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ [].foldLeft(e)(f)  // definition of foldLeft</p>

<p>// case d2 where length is 1, i.e. d2 == [a] for some a of type A
(d1 ++ [a]).foldLeft(e)(f)
== f(d1.foldLeft(e)(f), a)  // definition of foldLeft and f
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ f(e, a)  // the type-law f(b, a) == b ++ f(e, a)
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ [a].foldLeft(e)(f)  // definition of foldLeft</p>

<p>// inductive step, assuming proof for d2' of length &lt;= n
// consider d2 of length n+1, i.e. d2 == d2' ++ [a], where d2' has length n
(d1 ++ d2).foldLeft(e)(f)
== (d1 ++ d2' ++ [a]).foldLeft(e)(f)  // definition of d2, d2', [a]
== f((d1 ++ d2').foldLeft(e)(f), a)  // definition of foldLeft and f
== (d1 ++ d2').foldLeft(e)(f) ++ f(e, a)  // type-law f(b, a) == b ++ f(e, a)
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ d2'.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ f(e, a)  // induction
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ d2'.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ [a].foldLeft(e)(f)  // def'n of foldLeft
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ (d2' ++ [a]).foldLeft(e)(f)  // induction
== d1.foldLeft(e)(f) ++ d2.foldLeft(e)(f)  // definition of d2 (QED)

    <updated>2016-08-31T17:55:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/08/31/supporting-competing-apis-in-scala-can-better-package-factoring-help</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> On and off over the last year, I've been working on a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/09/26/a-library-of-binary-tree-algorithms-as-mixable-scala-traits/">library</a> of tree and map classes in Scala that happen to make use of some algebraic structures (mostly monoids or related concepts).
 In my initial implementations, I made use of the popular <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird">algebird</a> variations on monoid and friends.
 In their incarnation as an <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird/pull/496">algebird PR</a> this was uncontroversial to say the least, but lately I have been re-thinking them as a <a href="https://github.com/isarn/isarn/pull/1">third-party Scala package</a>.</p>

<p>This immediately raised some interesting and thorny questions:
in an ecosystem that contains not just <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird">algebird</a>, but other popular alternatives such as <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats">cats</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">scalaz</a>, what algebra API should I use in my code?
How best to allow the library user to interoperate with the algebra libray of their choice?
Can I accomplish these things while also avoiding any problematic package dependencies in my library code?</p>

<p>In Scala, the second question is relatively straightforward to answer.
I can write my interface using <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/implicit-conversions">implicit conversions</a>, and provide sub-packages that provide such conversions from popular algebra libraries into the library I actually use in my code.
A library user can import the predefined implicit conversions of their choice, or if necessary provide their own.</p>

<p>So far so good, but that leads immediately back to the first question -- what API should <strong><em>I</em></strong> choose to use internally in my own library?</p>

<p>One obvious approach is to just pick one of the popular options (I might favor <code>cats</code>, for example) and write my library code using that.
If a library user also prefers <code>cats</code>, great.
Otherwise, they can import the appropritate implicit conversions from their favorite alternative into <code>cats</code> and be on their way.</p>

<p>But this solution is not without drawbacks.
Anybody using my library will now be including <code>cats</code> as a transitive dependency in their project, even if they are already using some other alternative.
Although <code>cats</code> is not an enormous library, that represents a fair amount of code sucked into my users' projects, most of which isn't going to be used at all.
More insidiously, I have now introduced the possiblity that the <code>cats</code> version I package with is out of sync with the version my library users are building against.
Version misalignment in transitive dependencies is a land-mine in project builds and very difficult to resolve.</p>

<p>A second approach I might use is to define some abstract algebraic traits of my own.
I can write my libraries in terms of this new API, and then provide implicit conversions from popular APIs into mine.</p>

<p>This approach has some real advantages over the previous.  Being entirely abstract, my internal API will be lightweight.  I have the option of including only the algebraic concepts I need.  It does not introduce any possibly problematic 3rd-party dependencies that might cause code bloat or versioning problems for my library users.</p>

<p>Although this is an effective solution, I find it dissatisfying for a couple reasons.
Firstly, my new internal API effectively represents <em>yet another competing algebra API</em>, and so I am essentially contributing to the proliferating-standards antipattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" alt="standards" /></p>

<p>Secondly, it means that I am not taking advantage of community knowledge.
The <code>cats</code> library embodies a great deal of cumulative human expertise in both category theory and Scala library design.
What does a good algebra library API look like?
Well, <em>it's likely to look a lot like <code>cats</code></em> of course!
The odds that I end up doing an inferior job designing my little internal vanity API are rather higher than the odds that I do as well or better.
The best I can hope for is to re-invent the wheel, with a real possibility that my wheel has corners.</p>

<p>Is there a way to resolve this unpalatable situation?
Can we design our projects to both remain flexible about interfacing with multiple 3rd-party alternatives, but avoid effectively writing <em>yet another alternative</em> for our own internal use?</p>

<p>I hardly have any authoritative answers to this problem, but I have one idea that might move toward a solution.
As I alluded to above, when I write my libraries, I am most frequently <em>only</em> interested in the API -- the abstract interface.
If I did go with writing my own algebra API, I would seek to define purely abstract traits.
Since my intention is that my library users would supply their own favorite library alternative, I would have no need or desire to instantiate any of my APIs.
That function would be provided by the separate sub-projects that provide implicit conversions from community alternatives into my API.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what if <code>cats</code> and <code>algebird</code> factored <em>their</em> libraries in a similar way?
What if I could include a sub-package like <code>cats-kernel-api</code>, or <code>algebird-core-api</code>, which contained <em>only</em> pure abstract traits for monoid, semigroup, etc?
Then I could choose my favorite community API, and code against it, with much less code bloat, and a much reduced vulnerability to any versioning drift.
I would still be free to provide implicit conversions and allow <em>my</em> users to make their own choice of library in their projects.</p>

<p>Although I find this idea attractive, it is certainly not foolproof.
For example, there is never a way to <em>guarantee</em> that versioning drift won't break an API.
APIs such as <code>cats</code> and <code>algebird</code> are likely to be unusually amenable to this kind of approach.
After all, their interfaces are primarily driven by underlying mathematical definitions, which are generally as stable as such things ever get.
However, APIs in general tend to be significantly more stable than underlying code.
And the most-stable subsets of APIs might be encoded as traits and exposed this way, allowing other more experimental API components to change at a higher frequency.
Perhaps library packages could even be factored in some way such as <code>library-stable-api</code> and <code>library-unstable-api</code>.
That would clearly add a bit of complication to library trait hierarchies, but the payoff in terms of increased 3rd-party usability might be worth it.</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/08/03/x-medoids-using-minimum-description-length-to-identify-the-k-in-k-medoids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Applying many popular clustering models, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-Means</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">K-Medoids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm#Gaussian_mixture">Gaussian Mixtures</a>, requires an up-front choice of the number of clusters -- the 'K' in K-Means, as it were.
Anybody who has ever applied these models is familiar with the inconvenient task of guessing what an appropriate value for K might actually be.
As the size and dimensionality of data grows, estimating a good value for K rapidly becomes an exercise in wild guessing and multiple iterations through the free-parameter space of possible K values.</p>

<p>There are some varied approaches in the community for addressing the task of identifying a good number of clusters in a data set.  In this post I want to focus on an approach that I think deserves more attention than it gets: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_description_length">Minimum Description Length</a>.</p>

<p>Many years ago I ran across a <a href="#cite1">superb paper</a> by Stephen J. Roberts on anomaly detection that described a method for <em>automatically</em> choosing a good value for the number of clusters based on the principle of Minimum Description Length.
Minimum Description Length (MDL) is an elegant framework for evaluating the parsimony of a model.
The Description Length of a model is defined as the amount of information needed to encode that model, plus the encoding-length of some data, <em>given</em> that model.
Therefore, in an MDL framework, a good model is one that allows an efficient (i.e. short) encoding of the data, but whose <em>own</em> description is <em>also</em> efficient
(This suggests connections between MDL and the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Machine_learning">learning as a form of data compression</a>).</p>

<p>For example, a model that directly memorizes all the data may allow for a very short description of the data, but the model itself will cleary require at least the size of the raw data to encode, and so direct memorization models generaly stack up poorly with respect to MDL.
On the other hand, consider a model of some Gaussian data.  We can describe these data in a length proportional to their log-likelihood under the Gaussian density.  Furthermore, the description length of the Gaussian model itself is very short; just the encoding of its mean and standard deviation.  And so in this case a Gaussian distribution represents an efficient model with respect to MDL.</p>

<p><strong>In summary, an MDL framework allows us to mathematically capture the idea that we only wish to consider increasing the complexity of our models if that buys us a corresponding increase in descriptive power on our data.</strong></p>

<p>In the case of <a href="#cite1">Roberts' paper</a>, the clustering model in question is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm#Gaussian_mixture">Gaussian Mixture Model</a> (GMM), and the description length expression to be optimized can be written as:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/mdl_gm_eq.png" alt="EQ-1" /></p>

<p>In this expression, X represents the vector of data elements.
The first term is the (negative) log-likelihood of the data, with respect to a candidate GMM having some number (K) of Gaussians; p(x) is the GMM density at point (x).
This term represents the cost of encoding the data, given that GMM.
The second term is the cost of encoding the GMM itself.
The value P is the number of free parameters needed to describe that GMM.
Assuming a dimensionality D for the data, then <nobr>P = K(D + D(D+1)/2):</nobr> D values for each mean vector, and <nobr>D(D+1)/2</nobr> values for each covariance matrix.</p>

<p>I wanted to apply this same MDL principle to identifying a good value for K, in the case of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">K-Medoids</a> model.
How best to adapt MDL to K-Medoids poses some problems.
In the case of K-Medoids, the <em>only</em> structure given to the data is a distance metric.
There is no vector algebra defined on data elements, much less any ability to model the points as a Gaussian Mixture.</p>

<p>However, any candidate clustering of my data <em>does</em> give me a corresponding distribution of distances from each data element to it's closest medoid.
I can evaluate an MDL measure on these distance values.
If adding more clusters (i.e. increasing K) does not sufficiently tighten this distribution, then its description length will start to increase at larger values of K, thus indicating that more clusters are not improving our model of the data.
Expressing this idea as an MDL formulation produces the following description length formula:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/mdl_km_eq.png" alt="EQ-2" /></p>

<p>Note that the first two terms are similar to the equation above; however, the underlying distribution <nobr>p(||x-c<sub>x</sub>||)</nobr> is now a distribution over the distances of each data element (x) to its closest medoid <nobr>c<sub>x</sub></nobr>, and P is the corresponding number of free parameters for this distribution (more on this below).
There is now an additional third term, representing the cost of encoding the K medoids.
Each medoid is a data element, and specifying each data element requires log|X| bits (or <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Nat.html">nats</a>, since I generally use natural logarithms), yielding an additional <nobr>(K)log|X|</nobr> in description length cost.</p>

<p>And so, an MDL-based algorithm for automatically identifying a good number of clusters (K) in a K-Medoids model is to run a K-Medoids clustering on my data, for some set of potential K values, and evaluate the MDL measure above for each, and choose the model whose description length L(X) is the smallest!</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, there is also an implied task of choosing a form (or a set of forms) for the distance distribution <nobr>p(||x-c<sub>x</sub>||)</nobr>.
At the time of this writing, I am fitting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">gamma distribution</a> to the distance data, and <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/xmedoids/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/cluster/KMedoids.scala#L578">using this gamma distribution</a> to compute log-likelihood values.
A gamma distribution has two free parameters -- a shape parameter and a location parameter -- and so currently the value of P is always 2 in my implementations.
I elaborated on some back-story about how I arrived at the decision to use a gamma distribution <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2016/07/09/approximating-a-pdf-of-distances-with-a-gamma-distribution/">here</a> and <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2016/06/08/exploring-the-effects-of-dimensionality-on-a-pdf-of-distances/">here</a>.
An additional reason for my choice is that the gamma distribution does have a fairly good shape coverage, including two-tailed, single-tailed, and/or exponential-like shapes.</p>

<p>Another observation (based on my blog posts mentioned above) is that my use of the gamma distribution implies a bias toward cluster distributions that behave (more or less) like Gaussian clusters, and so in this respect its current behavior is probably somewhat analogous to the <a href="#cite2">G-Means algorithm</a>, which identifies clusterings that yield Gaussian disributions in each cluster.
Adding other candidates for distance distributions is a useful subject for future work, since there is no compelling reason to either favor or assume Gaussian-like cluster distributions over <em>all</em> kinds of metric spaces.
That said, I am seeing reasonable results even on data with clusters that I suspect are not well modeled as Gaussian distributions.
Perhaps the shape-coverage of the gamma distribution is helping to add some robustness.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the MDL-enhanced K-Medoids in action, I will illustrate its performance on some data sets that are amenable to graphic representation.  The code I used to generate these results is <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/xmedoids/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/cluster/KMedoids.scala#L629">here</a>.</p>

<p>Consider this synthetic data set of points in 2D space.  You can see that I've generated the data to have two latent clusters:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/k2_raw.png" alt="K2-Raw" /></p>

<p>I collected the description-length values for candidate K-Medoids models having 1 up to 10 clusters, and plotted them.  This plot shows that the clustering with minimal description length had 2 clusters:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/k2_mdl.png" alt="K2-MDL" /></p>

<p>When I plot that optimal clustering at K=2 (with cluster medoids marked in black-and-yellow), the clustering looks good:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/k2_clusters.png" alt="K2-Clusters" /></p>

<p>To show the behavior for a different optimal value, the following plots demonstrate the MDL K-Medoids results on data where the number of latent clusters is 4:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/k4_raw.png" alt="K4-Raw" />
<img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/k4_mdl.png" alt="K4-MDL" />
<img src="/assets/images/xmedoids/k4_clusters.png" alt="K4-Clusters" /></p>

<p>A final comment on Minimum Description Length approaches to clustering -- although I focused on K-Medoids models in this post, the basic approach (and I suspect even the same description length formulation) would apply equally well to K-Means, and possibly other clustering models.
Any clustering model that involves a distance function from elements to some kind of cluster center should be a good candidate.
I intend to keep an eye out for applications of MDL to <em>other</em> learning models, as well.</p>

To help explain this to myself I derived a formula for this distribution, assuming a unit multivariate Gaussian.  For distance (aka radius) r, and spatial dimension d, the PDF of distances is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dist_dist/gwwv5a5.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Recall that the form of this PDF is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_gamma_distribution">generalized gamma distribution</a>, with scale parameter <nobr>a=sqrt(2),</nobr> shape parameter p=2, and free shape parameter (d) representing the dimensionality.</p>

<p>I was interested in fitting parameters to such a distribution, using some distance data from a clustering algorithm.  <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> comes with a predefined method for fitting generalized gamma parameters, however I wished to implement something similar using <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/">Apache Commons Math</a>, which does not have native support for fitting a generalized gamma PDF.  I even went so far as to start working out <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2016/06/15/computing-derivatives-of-the-gamma-function/">some of the math</a> needed to augment the Commons Math <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/apidocs/org/apache/commons/math3/analysis/differentiation/package-summary.html">Automatic Differentiation libraries</a> with Gamma function differentiation needed to numerically fit my parameters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have been fitting a <em>non generalized</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">gamma distribution</a> to the distance data, as a sort of rough cut, using a fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution#Maximum_likelihood_estimation">non-iterative approximation</a> to the parameter optimization.  Consistent with my habit of asking the obvious question last, I tried plotting this gamma approximation against distance data, to see how well it compared against the PDF that I derived.</p>

<p>Surprisingly (at least to me), my approximation using the gamma distribution is a very effective fit for spatial dimensionalities <nobr> >= 2 </nobr>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gamma_approx/approx_plot.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>As the plot shows, only for the 1-dimension case is the gamma approximation substiantially deviating.  In fact, the fit appears to get better as dimensionality increases.  To address the 1D case, I can easily test the fit of a half-gaussian as a possible model.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I'll describe a simple algorithm to compute the kth derivatives of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>.</p>

<p>I'll start by showing a simple recursion relation for these derivatives, and then gives its derivation.  The kth derivative of Gamma(x) can be computed as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dgamma/hvqtl52.png" alt="Equation 1" /></p>

<p>The recursive formula for the D<sub>k</sub> functions has an easy inductive proof:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dgamma/h79ued9.png" alt="Equation 2" /></p>

<p>Computing the next value D<sub>k</sub> requires knowledge of D<sub>k-1</sub> but also derivative D'<sub>k-1</sub>.  If we start expanding terms, we see the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dgamma/hhvonpa.png" alt="Equation 3" /></p>

<p>Continuing the process above it is not hard to see that we can continue expanding until we are left only with terms of <nobr>D<sub>1</sub><sup>(*)</sup>(x);</nobr> that is, various derivatives of <nobr>D<sub>1</sub>(x)</nobr>.  Furthermore, each layer of substitutions adds an order to the derivatives, so that we will eventually be left with terms involving the derivatives of <nobr>D<sub>1</sub>(x)</nobr> up to the (k-1)th derivative. Note that these will all be successive orders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamma_function">polygamma function</a>.</p>

<p>What we want, to do these computations systematically, is a formula for computing the nth derivative of a term <nobr>D<sub>k</sub>(x)</nobr>.  Examining the first few such derivatives suggests a pattern:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dgamma/jqwqpzy.png" alt="Equation 4" /></p>

<p>Generalizing from the above, we see that the formula for the nth derivative is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dgamma/jamccnh.png" alt="Equation 5" /></p>

<p>We are now in a position to fill in the triangular table of values, culminating in the value of <nobr>D<sub>k</sub>(x):</nobr></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dgamma/jj9ph5l.png" alt="Equation 6" /></p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the basis row of values <nobr>D<sub>1</sub><sup>(*)</sup>(x)</nobr> are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamma_function">polygamma functions</a> where <nobr>D<sub>1</sub><sup>(n)</sup>(x) = polygamma<sup>(n)</sup>(x)</nobr>.  The first two polygammas, order 0 and 1, are simply the digamma and trigamma functions, respectively, and are available with most numeric libraries.  Computing the general polygamma is a project, and blog post, for another time, but the standard polynomial approximation for the digamma function can of course be differentiated...  Happy Computing!</p>
