    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will demonstrate how to do reservoir sampling orders of magnitude faster than the traditional "naive" reservoir sampling algorithm, using a fast high-fidelity approximation to the reservoir sampling-gap distribution.</p>

<blockquote><p>The code I used to collect the data for this post can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/reservoir/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/sample/reservoir/reservoir.scala">here</a>.  I generated the plots using the <a href="https://github.com/quantifind/wisp">quantifind WISP</a> project.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> for the corresponding sampling distributions.  More recently, I also began exploring whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">reservoir sampling</a> might also be optimized using the gap sampling technique, by deriving the <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">reservoir sampling gap distribution</a>.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it presupposes that you can actually draw values from that distribution substantially faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.  I was unable to come up with a "direct" algorithm for drawing samples from P(k) above (I suspect none exists), however I also know the CDF F(k), so it <em>is</em> possible to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inversion sampling</a>, which runs in logarithmic time w.r.t the desired accuracy.  Although its logarithmic cost effectively guarantees that it will be a net efficiency win for sufficiently large (j), it still involves a substantial number of computations to yield its samples, and it seems unlikely to be competitive with straight "naive" reservoir sampling over many real-world data sizes, where (j) may never grow very large.</p>

<p>Well, if exact computations are too expensive, we can always look for a fast approximation.  Consider the original "first principles" formula for the sampling gap P(k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>As the figure above alludes to, if (j) is relatively large compared to (k), then values (j+1),(j+2)...(j+k) are all going to be effectively "close" to (j), and so we can replace them all with (j) as an approximation.  Note that the resulting approximation is just the PMF of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a>, with probability of success p=(R/j), and we already saw how to efficiently draw values from a geometric distribution from our experience with Bernoulli sampling.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to hope that this approximation will be useful?  For reasons that are similar to those for Bernoulli gap sampling, it will only be efficient to employ gap sampling when the probability (R/j) becomes small enough.  From our experiences with Bernoulli sampling that is <em>at least</em> j>=2R.  So, we have some assurance that (j) itself will be never be <em>very</em> small.  What about (k)?  Note that a geometric distribution "favors" smaller values of (k) -- that is, small values of (k) have the highest probabilities.  In fact, the smaller that (j) is, the larger the probability (R/j) is, and so the more likely that (k) values that are small relative to (j) will be the frequent ones.  It is also promising that the true distribution for P(k) <em>also</em> favors smaller values of (k) (in fact it favors them even a bit more strongly than the approximation).</p>

<p>Although it is encouraging, it is also clear that my argument above is limited to heuristic hand-waving.  What does this approximation really <em>look</em> like, compared to the true distribution?  Fortunately, it is easy to plot both distributions numerically, since we now know the formulas for both:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/CDFs_R=10.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>The plot above shows that, in fact, the geometric approximation is a <em>surprisingly good</em> approximation to the true distribution!  Furthermore, the approximation remains good as both (j) and (k) grow larger.</p>

<p>Our numeric eye-balling looks quite promising.  Is there an effective way to <em>measure</em> how good this approximation is?  One useful measure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic</a>, which is just the maximum absolute error between two cumulative distributions.  Here is a plot of the D statistic for reservoir size R=10, as (j) varies across several magnitudes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=10.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This plot is also good news: we can see that deviation, as measured by D, remains bounded at a small value (less than 0.0262).  As this is for the specific value R=10, we also want to know how things change as reservoir size changes:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/R=all.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p>The news is still good!  As reservoir size grows, the approximation only gets better: the D values get smaller as R increases, and remain asymptotically bounded as (j) increases.</p>

<p>Now we have some numeric assurance that the geometric approximation is a good one, and stays good as reservoir size grows and sampling runs get longer.  However, we should also verify that an actual implementation of the approximation works as expected.</p>

<p>Here is pseudocode for an implementation of reservoir sampling using the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<pre><code>// data is array to sample from
// R is the reservoir size
function reservoirFast(data: Array, R: Int) {
  n = data.length
  // Initialize reservoir with first R elements of data:
  res = data[0 until R]
  // Until this threshold, use traditional sampling.  This value may
  // depend on performance characteristics of random number generation and/or
  // numeric libraries:
  t = 4 * R
  j = 1 + R
  while (j &lt; n  &amp;&amp;  j &lt;= t) {
    k = randomInt(j) // random integer &gt;= 0 and &lt; j
    if (k &lt; R) res[k] = data[j]
    j = j + 1
  }
  // Once gaps become significant, it pays to do gap sampling
  while (j &lt; n) {
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = R/j
    p = R / j
    u = randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1
    g = floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    j = j + g
    if (j &lt; n) {
      k = randomInt(R)
      res[k] = data[j]
    }
    j = j + 1
  }
  // return the reservoir
  return res
}
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a plot that shows two-sample D statistics, comparing the distribution in sample gaps between runs of the exact "naive" reservoir sampling with the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/D_naive_vs_fast.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>As expected, the measured difference in sampling characteristics between naive and fast approximation are small, confirming the numeric predictions.</p>

<p>Since the point of this exercise was to achieve faster random sampling, it remains to measure what kind of speed improvements the fast approximation provides.  As a point of reference, here is a plot of run times for reservoir sampling over 10<sup>8</sup> integers:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/naive_sample_time_vs_R.png" title="Figure 7" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<p>As expected, sample time remains constant at around 1.5 seconds, regardless of reservoir size, since the naive algorithm always samples from its RNG per each sample.</p>

<p>Compare this to the corresponding plot for the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sample_times_vs_R.png" title="Figure 8" alt="Figure 8" /></p>

<p>Firstly, we see that the sampling times are <em>much faster</em>, as originally anticipated in my <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">previous post</a> -- in the neighborhood of 3 orders of magnitude faster.  Secondly, we see that the sampling times do increase as a linear function of reservoir size.  Based on our experience with Bernoulli gap sampling, this is expected; the sampling probabilities are given by (R/j), and therefore the amount of sampling is proportional to R.</p>

<p>Another property anticipated in my previous post was that the efficiency of gap sampling should continue to increase as the amount of data sampled grows; the sampling probability being (R/j), the probability of sampling decreases as j gets larger, and so the corresponding gap sizes grow.  The following plot verifies this property, holding reservoir size R constant, and increasing the data size:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sampling_efficiency.png" title="Figure 9" alt="Figure 9" /></p>

<p>The sampling time (per million elements) decreases as the sample size grows, as predicted by the formula.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have demonstrated that a geometric distribution can be used as a high quality approximation to the true sampling gap distribution for reservoir sampling, which allows reservoir sampling to be performed much faster than the naive algorithm while still retaining sampling quality.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I am going to describe some work I've done recently on a system of Scala traits that support tree-based collection algorithms prefix-sum, nearest key query and value increment in a mixable format, all backed by Red-Black balanced tree logic, which is also a fully inheritable trait.</p>

<h5>A Motivating Use Case</h5>

<p>The skeptical programmer may be wondering what the point of Yet Another Map Collection really is, much less an entire class hierarchy.  The use case that inspired this work was <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird/pull/495">my project</a> of implementing the <a href="https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf">t-digest algorithm</a>.  Discussion of t-digest is beyond the scope of this post, but suffice it to say that constructing a t-digest requires the maintenance of a collection of "cluster" objects, that needs to satisfy the following several properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>an entry contains one <strong>or more</strong> cluster objects at a given numeric location</li>
<li>entries are maintained in a numeric key order</li>
<li>entries will be frequently inserted and deleted, in arbitrary order</li>
<li>given a numeric key value, be able to find the entry nearest to that value</li>
<li>given a key, compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum">prefix-sum</a> for that value</li>
<li>all of the above should be bounded by logarithmic time complexity</li>
</ol>


<p>Propreties 2,3 and 6 are commonly satisfied by a map structure backed by some variety of balanced tree representation, of which the best-known is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-Black tree</a>.</p>

<p>Properties 1, 4 and 5 are more interesting.  Property 1 -- representing a collection of multiple objects at each entry -- can be accomplished in a generalizable way by noting that a collection is representable as a monoid, and so supporting values that can be incremented with respect to a <a href="http://twitter.github.io/algebird/index.html#com.twitter.algebird.Monoid">user-supplied monoid relation</a> can satisfy property-1, but also can support many other kinds of update, including but not limited to classical numeric incrementing operations.</p>

<p>Properties 4 and 5 -- nearest-entry queries and prefix-sum queries -- are also both supportable in logarithmic time using a tree data structure, provided that tree is balanced.  Again, the details of the algorithms are out of the current scope, however they are not extremely complex, and their implementations are available in the code.</p>

<p>A reader with their software engineering hat on will notice that these properties are <em>orthogonal</em>.  A programmer might be interested in a data structure supporting any one of them, or in some mixed combination.   This kind of situation fairly shouts "Scala traits" (or, alternatively, interfaces in Java, etc).  With that idea in mind, I designed a system of Scala collection traits that support all of the above properties, in a pure trait form that is fully "mixable" by the programmer, so that one can use exactly the properties needed, but not pay for anything else.</p>

<p><a name="overview"></a></p>

<h5>Library Overview</h5>

<p>The library consists broadly of 3 kinds of traits:</p>

<ul>
<li>tree node traits -- implement core tree support for some functionality</li>
<li>collection traits -- provide additional collection API methods the user</li>
<li>collections -- instantiate a usable incarnation of a collection</li>
</ul>


<p>For the programmer who wishes to either create a trait mixture, or add new mixable traits, the collections also function as reference implementations.</p>

<p>The three tables that follow summarize the currently available traits of each kind listed above.  They are (at the time of this posting) all under the package namespace <code>com.redhat.et.silex.maps</code>:</p>

<p>The following diagram summarizes the organization and inheritance relationships of the classes.</p>

<p><a name="redblack"></a></p>

<h5>A Red/Black Tree Base Class</h5>

<p>The most fundamental trait in this hierarchy is the trait that embodies Red-Black balancing; a "red-black-ness" trait, as it were.  This trait supplies the axiomatic tree operations of insertion, deletion and key lookup, where the Red-Black balancing operations are encapsulated for insertion (due to <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=44273">Chris Okasaki</a>) and deletion (due to <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/smk/redblack/rb.html">Stefan Kahrs</a>)  Note that Red-Black trees do not assume a separate value, as in a map, but require only keys (thus implementing an ordered set over the key type):</p>

<p>``` scala
object tree {
  /<em>* The color (red or black) of a node in a Red/Black tree </em>/
  sealed trait Color
  case object R extends Color
  case object B extends Color</p>

<p>  /<em>* Defines the data payload of a tree node </em>/
  trait Data[K] {</p>

<pre><code>/** The axiomatic unit of data for R/B trees is a key */
val key: K
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  /** Base class of a Red/Black tree node</p>

<pre><code>* @tparam K The key type
*/
</code></pre>

<p>  trait Node[K] {</p>

<pre><code>/** The ordering that is applied to key values */
val keyOrdering: Ordering[K]

/** Instantiate an internal node. */
protected def iNode(color: Color, d: Data[K], lsub: Node[K], rsub: Node[K]): INode[K]

// ... declarations for insertion, deletion and key lookup ...

// ... red-black balancing rules ...
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>   /<em>* Represents a leaf node in the Red Black tree system </em>/
  trait LNode[K] extends Node[K] {</p>

<pre><code>// ... basis case insertion, deletion, lookup ...
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  /<em>* Represents an internal node (Red or Black) in the Red Black tree system </em>/
  trait INode[K] extends Node[K] {</p>

<pre><code>/** The Red/Black color of this node */
val color: Color
/** Including, but not limited to, the key */
val data: Data[K]
/** The left sub-tree */
val lsub: Node[K]
/** The right sub-tree */
val rsub: Node[K]

// ... implementations for insertion, deletion, lookup ...
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>``
I will assume most readers are familiar with basic binary tree operations, and the Red-Black rules are described elsewhere (I adapted them from the Scala red-black implementation).  For the purposes of this discussion, the most interesting feature is that this is a _pure Scala trait_.  All</code>val` declarations are abstract.  This trait, by itself, cannot function without a subclass to eventually perform dependency injection.   However, this abstraction allows the trait to be inherited freely -- any programmer can inherit from this trait and get a basic Red-Black balanced tree for (nearly) free, as long as a few basic principles are adhered to for proper dependency injection.</p>

<p>Another detail to call out is the abstraction of the usual <code>key</code> with a <code>Data</code> element.  This element represents any node payload that is moved around as a unit during tree structure manipulations, such as balancing pivots.  In the case of a map-like subclass, <code>Data</code> is extended to include a <code>value</code> field as well as a <code>key</code> field.</p>

<p>The other noteworthy detail is the abstract definition <code>def iNode(color: Color, d: Data[K], lsub: Node[K], rsub: Node[K]): INode[K]</code> - this is the function called to create any new tree node.  In fact, this function, when eventually instantiated, is what performs dependency injection of other tree node fields.</p>

<p><a name="nodemap"></a></p>

<h5>Node Inheritance Example: NodeMap[K,V]</h5>

<p>A relatively simple example of node inheritance is hopefully instructive.  Here is the definition for tree nodes supporting a key/value map:</p>

<p>``` scala
object tree {
  /<em>* Trees that back a map-like object have a value as well as a key </em>/
  trait DataMap[K, V] extends Data[K] {</p>

<pre><code>val value: V
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  /** Base class of ordered K/V tree node</p>

<pre><code>* @tparam K The key type
* @tparam V The value type
*/
</code></pre>

<p>  trait NodeMap[K, V] extends Node[K]</p>

<p>  trait LNodeMap[K, V] extends NodeMap[K, V] with LNode[K]</p>

<p>  trait INodeMap[K, V] extends NodeMap[K, V] with INode[K] {</p>

<pre><code>val data: DataMap[K, V]
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>Note that in this case very little is added to the red/black functionality already provided by <code>Node[K]</code>.  A <code>DataMap[K,V]</code> trait is defined to add a <code>value</code> field in addition to the <code>key</code>, and the internal node <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> refines the type of its <code>data</code> field to be <code>DataMap[K,V]</code>.  The semantics is little more than "tree nodes now carry a value in addition to a key."</p>

<p>A tree node trait inherits from its own parent class <em>and</em> the corresponding traits for any mixed-in functionality.  So for example <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> inherits from <code>NodeMap[K,V]</code> but also <code>INode[K]</code>.</p>

<p><a name="orderedmaplike"></a></p>

<h5>Collection Trait Example: OrderedMapLike[K,V,IN,M]</h5>

<p>Continuing with the ordered map example, here is the definition of the collection trait for an ordered map:</p>

<p>``` scala
trait OrderedMapLike[K, V, IN &lt;: INodeMap[K, V], M &lt;: OrderedMapLike[K, V, IN, M]]</p>

<pre><code>extends NodeMap[K, V] with OrderedLike[K, IN, M] {
</code></pre>

<p>  /<em>* Obtain a new map with a (key, val) pair inserted </em>/
  def +(kv: (K, V)) = this.insert(</p>

<pre><code>new DataMap[K, V] {
  val key = kv._1
  val value = kv._2
}).asInstanceOf[M]
</code></pre>

<p>  /<em>* Get the value stored at a key, or None if key is not present </em>/
  def get(k: K) = this.getNode(k).map(_.data.value)</p>

<p>  /<em>* Iterator over (key,val) pairs, in key order </em>/
  def iterator = nodesIterator.map(n => ((n.data.key, n.data.value)))</p>

<p>  /<em>* Container of values, in key order </em>/
  def values = valuesIterator.toIterable</p>

<p>  /<em>* Iterator over values, in key order </em>/
  def valuesIterator = nodesIterator.map(_.data.value)
}
<code>``
You can see that this trait supplies collection API methods that a Scala programmer will recognize as being standard for any map-like collection.  Note that this trait also inherits other standard methods from</code>OrderedLike[K,IN,M]<code>(common to both sets and maps) and _also_ inherits from</code>NodeMap[K,V]<code>: In other words, a collection is effectively yet another kind of tree node, with additional collection API methods mixed in.   Note also the use of "self types" (the type parameter</code>M`), which allows the collection to return objects of its own kind.  This is crucial for allowing operations like data insertion to return an object that also supports node insertion, and to maintain consistency of type across operations.  The collection type is properly "closed" with respect to its own operations.</p>

<p><a name="orderedmap"></a></p>

<h5>Collection Example: OrderedMap[K,V]</h5>

<p>To conclude the ordered map example, consider the task of defining a concrete instantiation of an ordered map:
``` scala
sealed trait OrderedMap[K, V] extends OrderedMapLike[K, V, INodeMap[K, V], OrderedMap[K, V]] {
  override def toString =</p>

<pre><code>"OrderedMap(" +
  nodesIterator.map(n =&gt; s"${n.data.key} -&gt; ${n.data.value}").mkString(", ") +
")"
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>``
You can see that (aside from a convenience override of</code>toString<code>) the trait</code>OrderedMap[K,V]<code>is nothing more than a vehicle for instantiating a particular concrete</code>OrderedMapLike[K,V,IN,M]<code>subtype, with particular concrete types for internal node (</code>INodeMap[K,V]`) and its own self-type.</p>

<p>Things become a little more interesting inside the companion object <code>OrderedMap</code>:
``` scala
object OrderedMap {
  def key<a href="implicit%20ord:%20Ordering[K]">K</a> = new AnyRef {</p>

<pre><code>def value[V]: OrderedMap[K, V] =
  new InjectMap[K, V](ord) with LNodeMap[K, V] with OrderedMap[K, V]
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>``
Note that the object returned by the factory method is upcast to</code>OrderedMap[K,V]<code>, but in fact has the more complicated type:</code>InjectMap[K,V] with LNodeMap[K,V] with OrderedMap[K,V]<code>.  There are a couple things going on here.  The trait</code>LNodeMap[K,V]` ensures that the new object is in particular a leaf node, which embodies a new empty tree in the Red-Black tree system.</p>

<p>The type <code>InjectMap[K,V]</code> has an even more interesting purpose.  Here is its definition:
``` scala
class InjectMap<a href="val%20keyOrdering:%20Ordering[K]">K, V</a> {
  def iNode(clr: Color, dat: Data[K], ls: Node[K], rs: Node[K]) =</p>

<pre><code>new InjectMap[K, V](keyOrdering) with INodeMap[K, V] with OrderedMap[K, V] {
  // INode
  val color = clr
  val lsub = ls
  val rsub = rs
  val data = dat.asInstanceOf[DataMap[K, V]]
}
</code></pre>

<code>``
Firstly, note that it is a bona fide _class_, as opposed to a trait.  This class is where, finally, all things abstract are made real -- "dependency injection" in the parlance of Scala idioms.  You can see that it defines the implementation of abstract method</code>iNode<code>, and that it does this by returning yet _another_</code>InjectMap[K,V]<code>object, mixed with both</code>INodeMap[K,V]<code>and</code>OrderedMap[K,V]`, thus maintaining closure with respect to all three slices of functionality: dependency injection, the proper type of internal node, and map collection methods.</p>

<p>The various abstract <code>val</code> fields <code>color</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>lsub</code> and <code>rsub</code> are all given concrete values inside of <code>iNode</code>.  Here is where the value of concrete "reference" implementations manifests.  Any fields in the relevant internal-node type must be instantiated here, and the logic of instantiation cannot be inherited while still preserving the ability to mix abstract traits.  Therefore, any programmer wishing to create a new concrete sub-class must replicate the logic for instantiating all inherited in an internal node.</p>

<p>Another example makes the implications more clear.  Here is the definition of injection for a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/rbtraits/src/test/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/maps/mixed.scala">collection that mixes in all three traits</a> for incrementable values, nearest-key queries, and prefix-sum queries:</p>

<p>``` scala
  class Inject[K, V, P](</p>

<pre><code>val keyOrdering: Numeric[K],
val valueMonoid: Monoid[V],
val prefixMonoid: IncrementingMonoid[P, V]) {
  def iNode(clr: Color, dat: Data[K], ls: Node[K], rs: Node[K]) =
  new Inject[K, V, P](keyOrdering, valueMonoid, prefixMonoid)
      with INodeTD[K, V, P] with TDigestMap[K, V, P] {
    // INode[K]
    val color = clr
    val lsub = ls.asInstanceOf[NodeTD[K, V, P]]
    val rsub = rs.asInstanceOf[NodeTD[K, V, P]]
    val data = dat.asInstanceOf[DataMap[K, V]]
    // INodePS[K, V, P]
    val prefix = prefixMonoid.inc(prefixMonoid.plus(lsub.pfs, rsub.pfs), data.value)
    // INodeNear[K, V]
    val kmin = lsub match {
      case n: INodeTD[K, V, P] =&gt; n.kmin
      case _ =&gt; data.key
    }
    val kmax = rsub match {
      case n: INodeTD[K, V, P] =&gt; n.kmax
      case _ =&gt; data.key
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```
Here you can see that all logic for both "basic" internal nodes and also for maintaining prefix sums, and key min/max information for nearest-entry queries, must be supplied.  If there is a singularity in this design here is where it is.  The saving grace is that it is localized into a single well defined place, and any logic can be transcribed from a proper reference implementation of whatever traits are being mixed.</p>

<p><a name="mixing"></a></p>

<h5>Finale: Trait Mixing</h5>

<p>I will conclude by showing the code for mixing tree node traits and collection traits, which is elegant.  Here are type definitions for tree nodes and collection traits that inherit from incrementable values, nearest-key queries, and prefix-sum queries, and there is almost no code except the proper inheritances:</p>

<p>``` scala
object tree {
  import com.redhat.et.silex.maps.increment.tree.<em>
  import com.redhat.et.silex.maps.prefixsum.tree.</em>
  import com.redhat.et.silex.maps.nearest.tree._</p>

<p>  trait NodeTD[K, V, P] extends NodePS[K, V, P] with NodeInc[K, V] with NodeNearMap[K, V]</p>

<p>  trait LNodeTD[K, V, P] extends NodeTD[K, V, P]</p>

<pre><code>  with LNodePS[K, V, P] with LNodeInc[K, V] with LNodeNearMap[K, V]
</code></pre>

<p>  trait INodeTD[K, V, P] extends NodeTD[K, V, P]</p>

<pre><code>  with INodePS[K, V, P] with INodeInc[K, V] with INodeNearMap[K, V] {
val lsub: NodeTD[K, V, P]
val rsub: NodeTD[K, V, P]
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>// ...</p>

<p>sealed trait TDigestMap[K, V, P]
  extends IncrementMapLike[K, V, INodeTD[K, V, P], TDigestMap[K, V, P]]
  with PrefixSumMapLike[K, V, P, INodeTD[K, V, P], TDigestMap[K, V, P]]
  with NearestMapLike[K, V, INodeTD[K, V, P], TDigestMap[K, V, P]] {</p>

<p>  override def toString = // ...
}

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/18/lightweight-non-negative-numerics-for-better-scala-type-signatures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I want to discuss several advantages of defining lightweight non-negative numeric types in Scala, whose primary benefit is that they allow improved type signatures for Scala functions and methods.  I'll first describe the simple class definition, and then demonstrate how it can be used in function signatures and the benefits of doing so.</p>

<p>If the following ideas interest you at all, I highly recommend looking at the <a href="https://github.com/fthomas/refined">'refined' project</a> authored by <a href="http://timepit.eu/~frank/">Frank S. Thomas</a>, which generalizes on the ideas below and supports additional static checking functionalities via macros.</p>

<h5>A Non-Negative Integer Type</h5>

<p>As a working example, I'll discuss a non-negative integer type <code>NonNegInt</code>.  My proposed definition is sufficiently lightweight to view as a single code block:</p>

<p>``` scala
object nonneg {
  import scala.language.implicitConversions</p>

<p>  class NonNegInt private (val value: Int) extends AnyVal</p>

<p>  object NonNegInt {</p>

<pre><code>def apply(v: Int) = {
  require(v &gt;= 0, "NonNegInt forbids negative integer values")
  new NonNegInt(v)
}

implicit def toNonNegInt(v: Int) = NonNegInt(v)
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  implicit def toInt(nn: NonNegInt) = nn.value
}
```</p>

<p>The notable properties and features of <code>NonNegInt</code> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>NonNegInt</code> is a value class around an <code>Int</code>, and so invokes no actual object construction or allocation</li>
<li>Its constructor is private, and so is safe from directly constructing around a negative integer</li>
<li>It supplies factory method <code>NonNegInt(v)</code> to construct a non negative integer value</li>
<li>It supplies implicit conversion from <code>Int</code> values to <code>NonNegInt</code></li>
<li>Both factory method and implicit conversion check for negative values.  There is no way to construct a <code>NonNegInt</code> that contains a negative integer value.</li>
<li>It also supplies implicit conversion from <code>NonNegInt</code> back to <code>Int</code>.  Moving back and forth between <code>Int</code> and <code>NonNegInt</code> is effectively transparent.</li>
</ul>


<p>The above properties work to make <code>NonNegInt</code> very lightweight with respect to size and runtime properties, and semantically safe in the sense that it is impossible to construct one with a negative value inside it.</p>

<h5>Application of <code>NonNegInt</code></h5>

<p>I primarily envision <code>NonNegInt</code> as an easy and informative way to declare function parameters that are only well defined for non-negative values, without the need to write any explicit checking code, and yet allowing the programmer to call the function with normal <code>Int</code> values, due to the implicit conversions:</p>

<p>``` scala
object example {
  import nonneg._</p>

<p>  def element<a href="seq:%20Seq[T],%20j:%20NonNegInt">T</a> = seq(j)</p>

<p>  // call element function with a regular Int index
  val e = element(Vector(1,2,3), 1) // e is set to 2
}
```</p>

<p>This short example demonstrates some appealing properties of <code>NonNegInt</code>.  Firstly, the constraint that index <code>j &gt;= 0</code> is enforced via the type definition, and so the programmer does not have to write the usual <code>require(j &gt;= 0, ...)</code> check (or worry about forgetting it).  Secondly, the implicit conversion from <code>Int</code> to <code>NonNegInt</code> means the programmer can just provide a regular integer value for parameter <code>j</code>, instead of having to explicitly say <code>NonNegInt(1)</code>.  Third, the implicit conversion from <code>NonNegInt</code> to <code>Int</code> means that <code>j</code> can easily be used anywhere a regular <code>Int</code> is used.  Last, and very definitely not least, the fact that function <code>element</code> requires a non-negative integer is obvious <strong>right in the function signature</strong>.  There is no need for a programmer to guess whether <code>j</code> can be negative, and no need for the author of <code>element</code> to document that <code>j</code> cannot be negative.  Its type makes that completely clear.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>In this post I've laid out some advantages of defining lightweight non-negative numeric types, in particular using <code>NonNegInt</code> as a working example.  Clearly, if you want to apply this idea, you'd want to also define <code>NonNegLong</code>, <code>NonNegDouble</code>, <code>NonNegFloat</code> and for that matter <code>PosInt</code>, <code>PosLong</code>, etc.  Happy computing!</p>

    <updated>2015-08-17T07:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> - that is, directly drawing random samples from the distribution of how many elements would be skipped over between actual samples taken.</p>

<p>Another popular sampling algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">Reservoir Sampling</a>.  Its sampling logic is a bit more complicated than Bernoulli or Poisson sampling, in the sense that the probability of sampling any given (jth) element <em>changes</em>. For a sampling reservoir of size R, and all j>R, the probability of choosing element (j) is R/j.  You can see that the potential payoff for gap-sampling is big, particularly as data size becomes large; as (j) approaches infinity, the probability R/j goes to zero, and the corresponding gaps between samples grow without bound.</p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it requires that (1) you actually <em>know</em> the sampling distribution, and (2) that you can effectively draw values from that distribution faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.</p>

<p>With that goal in mind, I derived the probability mass function (pmf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the sampling gap distribution of reservoir sampling.  In this post I will show the derivations.</p>

<h3>The Sampling Gap Distribution</h3>

<p>In the interest of making it easy to get at the actual answers, here are the pmf and cdf for the Reservoir Sampling Gap Distribution.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>In the derivations that follow, I will keep to some conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>R = the sampling reservoir size.  R > 0.</li>
<li>j = the index of a data element being considered for sampling.  j > R.</li>
<li>k = the size of a gap between samples.  k >= 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>P(k) is the probability that the gap between one sample and the next is of size k.  The support for P(k) is over all k>=0.  I will generally assume that j>R, as the first R samples are always loaded into the reservoir and the actual random sampling logic starts at j=R+1.  The constraint j>R will also be relevant to many binomial coefficient expressions, where it ensures the coefficient is well defined.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Probability Mass Function, P(k)</h3>

<p>Suppose we just chose (randomly) to sample data element (j-1).  Now we are interested in the probability distribution of the next sampling gap.  That is, the probability P(k) that we will <em>not</em> sample the next (k) elements {j,j+1,...j+k-1}, and sample element (j+k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure1.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>By arranging the product terms in descending order as above, you can see that they can be written as factorial quotients:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Now we apply <a href="#LemmaA">Lemma A</a>.  The 2nd case (a&lt;=b) of the Lemma applies, since (j-1-R)&lt;=j, so we have:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure3.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>And so we have now derived a compact, closed-form expression for P(k).</p>

<h3>Deriving the Cumulative Distribution Function, F(k)</h3>

<p>Now that we have a derivation for the pmf P(k), we can tackle a derivation for the cdf.  First I will make note of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Series_involving_binomial_coefficients">useful identity</a> that I scraped off of Wikipedia (I substituted (x) => (a) and (k) => (b)):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/identity1.png" title="identity 1" alt="identity 1" /></p>

<p>The cumulative distribution function for the sampling gap, F(k), is of course just the sum over P(t), for (t) from 0 up to (k):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure4.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This is a closed-form solution, but we can apply a bit more simplification:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure5.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>We have derived closed-form expressions for the pmf and cdf of the Reservoir Sampling gap distribution:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>In order to apply these results to a practical gap-sampling implementation of Reservoir Sampling, we would next need a way to efficiently sample from P(k), to obtain gap sizes to skip over.  How to accomplish this is an open question, but knowing a formula for P(k) and F(k) is a start.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-14T14:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/14/generalizing-kendalls-tau</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have been applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient">Kendall's Tau</a> as an evaluation metric to assess how well a regression model ranks input samples, with respect to a known correct ranking.</p>

<p>The process of implementing the Kendall's Tau statistic, with my software engineer's hat on, caused me to reflect a bit on how it could be generalized beyond the traditional application of ranking numeric pairs.  In this post I'll discuss the generalization of Kendall's Tau to non-numeric data, and also generalizing from totally ordered data to partial orderings.</p>

<h5>A Review of Kendall's Tau</h5>

<p>I'll start with a brief review of Kendall's Tau.  For more depth, a good place to start is the Wikipedia article at the link above.</p>

<p>Consider a sequence of (n) observations where each observation is a pair (x,y), where we wish to measure how well a ranking by x-values agrees with a ranking by the y-values.  Informally, Kendall's Tau (aka the Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient) is the difference between number of observation-pairs (pairs of pairs, if you will) whose ordering <em>agrees</em> ("concordant" pairs) and the number of such pairs whose ordering <em>disagrees</em> ("discordant" pairs).  This difference is divided by the total number of observation pairs.</p>

<p>The commonly-used formulation of Kendall's Tau is the "Tau-B" statistic, which accounts for observed pairs having tied values in either x or y as being neither concordant nor discordant:</p>

<h6>Figure 1: Kendall's Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_1.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The formulation above has quadratic complexity, with respect to data size (n).  It is possible to rearrange this computation in a way that can be computed in (n)log(n) time[1]:</p>

<h6>Figure 2: An (n)log(n) formulation of Kendall's Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_2.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The details of performing this computation can be found at [1] or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient#Algorithms">Wikipedia entry</a>.  For my purposes, I'll note that it requires two (n)log(n) sorts of the data, which becomes relevant below.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Non-Numeric Values</h5>

<p>Generalizing Kendall's Tau to non-numeric values is mostly just making the observation that the definition of "concordant" and "discordant" pairs is purely based on comparing x-values and y-values (and, in the (n)log(n) formulation, performing sorts on the data).  From the software engineer's perspective this means that the computations are well defined on any data type with an ordering relation, which includes numeric types but also chars, strings, sequences of any element supporting an ordering, etc.  Significantly, most programming languages support the concept of defining ordering relations on arbitrary data types, which means that <em><em>Kendall's Tau can, in principle, be computed on literally any kind of data structure</em></em>, provided you supply it with a well defined ordering.  Furthermore, an examination of the algorithms shows that values of x and y need not even be of the same type, nor do they require the same ordering.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Partial Orderings</h5>

<p>When I brought this observation up, my colleague <a href="http://chapeau.freevariable.com/">Will Benton</a> asked the very interesting question of whether it's also possible to compute Kendall's Tau on objects that have only a <em>partial ordering</em>.  It turns out that you <em><em>can</em></em> define Kendall's Tau on partially ordered data, by defining the case of two non-comparable x-values, or y-values, as another kind of tie.</p>

<p>The big caveat with this definition is that the (n)log(n) optimization does not apply.  Firstly, the optimized algorithm relies heavily on (n)log(n) sorting, and there is no unique full sorting of elements that are only partially ordered.  Secondly, the formula's definition of the quantities n1, n2 and n3 is founded on the assumption that element equality is transitive; this is why you can count a number of tied values, t, and use t(t-1)/2 as the corresponding number of tied pairs.  But in a partial ordering, this assumption is violated. Consider the case where (a) &lt; (b), but (a) is non-comparable to (c) and (b) is also non-comparable to (c).  By our definition, (a) is tied with (c), and (c) is tied with (b), but transitivity is violated, as (a) &lt; (b).</p>

<p>So how <em>can</em> we compute Tau in this case?  Consider (n1) and (n2), in Figure-1.  These values represent the number of pairs that were tied wrt (x) and (y), respectively.  We can't use the shortcut formulas for (n1) and (n2), but we can count them directly, pair by pair, simply by conducting the traditional quadratic iteration over pairs, and incrementing (n1) whenever two x-values are noncomparable, and incrementing (n2) whenever two y-values are non-comparable, just as we increment (nc) and (nd) to count concordant and discordant pairs.  With this modification, we can apply the formula in Figure-1 as-is.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>I made these observations without any particular application in mind. However, my instincts as a software engineer tell me that making generalizations in this way often paves the way for new ideas, once the generalized concept is made available.  With luck, it will inspire either me or somebody else to apply Kendall's Tau in interesting new ways.</p>
