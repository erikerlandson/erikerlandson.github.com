    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have been applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient">Kendall's Tau</a> as an evaluation metric to assess how well a regression model ranks input samples, with respect to a known correct ranking.</p>

<p>The process of implementing the Kendall's Tau statistic, with my software engineer's hat on, caused me to reflect a bit on how it could be generalized beyond the traditional application of ranking numeric pairs; what follows is a brief discussion of these reflections.</p>

<h5>A Review of Kendall's Tau</h5>

<p>I'll start with a brief review of Kendall's Tau.  For more depth, a good place to start is the Wikipedia article at the link above.</p>

<p>Consider a sequence of (n) observations where each observation is a pair (x,y), where we wish to measure how well a ranking by x-values agrees with a ranking by the y-values.  Informally, Kendall's Tau (aka the Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient) is the difference between number of observation-pairs (pairs of pairs, if you will) whose ordering <em>agrees</em> ("concordant" pairs) and the number of such pairs whose ordering <em>disagrees</em> ("discordant" pairs).  This difference is divided by the total number of observation pairs.</p>

<p>The commonly-used formulation of Kendall's Tau is the "Tau-B" statistic, which accounts for observed pairs having tied values in either x or y as being neither concordant nor discordant:</p>

<h6>Figure 1: Kendall's Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_1.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The formulation above has quadratic complexity, with respect to data size (n).  It is possible to rearrange this computation in a way that can be computed in (n)log(n) time[1]:</p>

<h6>Figure 2: An (n)log(n) formulation of Kendall's Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_2.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The details of performing this computation can be found at [1] or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient#Algorithms">Wikipedia entry</a>.  For my purposes, I'll note that it requires two (n)log(n) sorts of the data, which becomes relevant below.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Non-Numeric Values</h5>

<p>Generalizing Kendall's Tau to non-numeric values is mostly just making the observation that the definition of "concordant" and "discordant" pairs is purely based on comparing x-values and y-values (and, in the (n)log(n) formulation, performing sorts on the data).  From the software engineer's perspective this means that the computations are well defined on any data type with an ordering relation, which includes numeric types but also chars, strings, sequences of any element supporting an ordering, etc.  Significantly, most programming languages support the concept of defining ordering relations on arbitrary data types, which means that <em><em>Kendall's Tau can, in principle, be computed on literally any kind of data structure</em></em>, provided you provide it with a well defined ordering.  Furthermore, an examination of the algorithms shows that values of x and y need not even be of the same type, nor do they require the same ordering.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Partial Orderings</h5>

<p>When I brought this observation up, my colleague <a href="http://chapeau.freevariable.com/">Will Benton</a> asked the very interesting question of whether it's also possible to compute Kendall's Tau on objects that have only a <em>partial ordering</em>.  It turns out that you <em><em>can</em></em> define Kendall's Tau on partially ordered data, by defining the case of two non-comparable x-values, or y-values, as another kind of tie.</p>

<p>The big caveat with this definition is that the (n)log(n) optimization does not apply.  Firstly, the optimized algorithm relies heavily on (n)log(n) sorting, and there is no unique full sorting of elements that are only partially ordered.  Secondly, the formula's definition of the quantities n1, n2 and n3 is founded on the assumption that element equality is transitive; this is why you can count a number of tied values, t, and use t(t-1)/2 as the corresponding number of tied pairs.  But in a partial ordering, this assumption is violated. Consider the case where (a) &lt; (b), but (a) is non-comparable to (c) and (b) is also non-comparable to (c).  By our definition, (a) is tied with (c), and (c) is tied with (b), but transitivity is violated, as (a) &lt; (b).</p>

<p>So how <em>can</em> we compute Tau in this case?  Consider (n1) and (n2), in Figure-1.  These values represent the number of pairs that were tied wrt (x) and (y), respectively.  We can't use the shortcut formulas for (n1) and (n2), but we can count them directly, pair by pair, simply by conducting the traditional quadratic iteration over pairs, and incrementing (n1) whenever two x-values are noncomparable, and incrementing (n2) whenever two y-values are non-comparable, just as we increment (nc) and (nd) to count concordant and discordant pairs.  With this modification, we can apply the formula in Figure-1 as-is.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>I made these observations without any particular application in mind. However, my instincts as a software engineer tell me that making generalizations in this way often paves the way for new ideas, once the generalized concept is made available.  With luck, it will inspire either me or somebody else to apply Kendall's Tau in interesting new ways.</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/05/06/parallel-k-medoids-using-scala-parseq</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scala supplies a <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">parallel collections library</a> that was designed to make it easy for a programmer to add parallel computing over the elements in a collection.  In this post, I will describe a case study of applying Scala's parallel collections to cleanly implement multithreading support for training a K-Medoids clustering model.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">K-Medoids clustering</a> is a relative of K-Means clustering that does not require an algebra over input data elements.  That is, K-Medoids requires only a distance metric defined on elements in the data space, and can cluster objects which do not have a well-defined concept of addition or division that is necessary for computing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid">centroids</a> required by K-Means.  For example, K-Medoids can cluster character strings, which have a notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">distance</a>, but no notion of summation that could be used to compute a geometric centroid.</p>

<p>This additional generality comes at a cost.  The medoid of a collection of elements is the member of the collection that minimizes some function F of the distances from that element to all the other elements in the collection.  For example, F might be the sum of distances from one element to all the elements, or perhaps the maximum distance, etc.  <strong>It is not hard to see that the cost of computing a medoid of (n) elements is quadratic in (n)</strong>: Evaluating F is linear in (n) and F in turn must be evaluated with respect to each element.  Furthermore, unlike centroid-based computations used in K-Means, computing a medoid does not naturally lend itself to common scale-out computing formalisms such as Spark RDDs, due to the full-cross-product nature of the computation.</p>

<p>With this in mind, a more traditional multithreading approach is a good candidate to achieve some practical parallelism on modern multi-core hardware.  I'll demonstrate that this is easy to implement in Scala with parallel sequences.</p>

<h3>Non-Parallel Code</h3>

<p>Consider a baseline non-parallel implementation of K-Medoids, as in the following example skeleton code.  (A working version of this code, under review at the time of this post, can be <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/parseq_blog/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/cluster/KMedoids.scala">viewed here</a>)</p>

<p>If we run the code above (de-skeletonized), then we might see something like this output from our benchmarking, where I clustered a dataset of 40,000 randomly-generated (x,y,z) points by Gaussian sampling around 5 chosen centers.  (This data is numeric, but I provide only a distance metric on the points.  K-Medoids has no knowledge of the data except that it can run the given metric function on it):</p>

<p>Observe that cluster sizes are generally not the same, and we can see the time per cluster varying quadratically with respect to cluster size.</p>

<h3>A First Take On Parallel K-Medoids</h3>

<p>Studying our non-parallel code above, we can see that the computation of each new medoid is independent, which makes it a likely place to inject some parallelism. A Scala sequence can be transformed into a corresponding parallel sequence using the <code>par</code> method, and so parallelizing our code is literally this simple:</p>

<p>In this block, I also apply <code>.seq</code> at the end, which is not always necessary but can avoid type mismatches between <code>Seq[T]</code> and <code>ParSeq[T]</code> under some circumstances.</p>

<p>In my case I also wish to exercise some control over the threading used by the parallelism, and so I explicitly assign a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread pool to the sequence:</p>

<p>Minor grievance: it would be nice if Scala supported some 'in-line' methods, like <code>seq.par(n)...</code> and <code>seq.par(threadPool)...</code>, instead of requiring the programmer to break the flow of the code to invoke <code>tasksupport =</code>, which returns <code>Unit</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we've parallelized our K-Medoids training, we should see how well it responds to additional threads.  I ran the above parallelized version using <code>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}</code> threads, on a machine with 40 cores, so that my benchmarking would not be impacted by attempting to run more threads than there are cores to support them.  I also ran two versions of test data.  The first I generated with clusters of equal size (5 clusters of ~8000 elements), and the second with one cluster being twice as large (1 cluster of ~13300 and 4 clusters of ~6700).  Following is a plot of throughput (iterations / second) versus threads:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/parseq/by_cluster_1.png" title="Throughput As A Function Of Threads" ></p>

<p>In the best of all possible worlds, our throughput would increase linearly with the number of threads; double the threads, double our iterations per second.  Instead, our throughput starts to increase nicely as we add threads, but hits a hard ceiling at 8 threads.  It is not hard to see why: our parallelism is limited by the number of elements in our collection of clusters.  In our case that is k = 5, and so we reach our ceiling at 8 threads, the first thread number >= 5.  Furthermore, we see that when the size of clusters is unequal, the throughput suffers even more.  The time required to complete the clustering is dominated by the most expensive element.  In our case, the cluster that is twice the size of other clusters:</p>

<h3>Take 2: Improving The Use Of Threads</h3>

<p>Fortunately it is not hard to improve on this situation.  If parallelizing by cluster is too coarse, we can try pushing our parallelism down one level of granularity.  In our case, that means parallelizing the outer loop of our medoid function, and it is just as easy as before:</p>

<p>Note that I retained the previous parallelism at the cluster level, otherwise the algorithm would execute parallel medoids, but one cluster at a time.  Also observe that we are applying the same thread pool we supplied to the ParSeq at the cluster level.  Scala's parallel logic can utilize the same thread pool at multiple granularities without blocking.  This makes it very clean to control the total number of threads used by some computation, by simply re-using the same threadpool across all points of parallelism.</p>

<p>Now, when we re-run our experiment, we see that our throughput continues to increase as we add threads.  The following plot illustrates the throughput increasing in comparison to the previous ceiling, and also that throughput is less sensitive to the cluster size, as threads can be allocated flexibly across clusters as they are available:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/parseq/all_1.png" title="Thread utilization improves at finer granularity" ></p>

<p>I hope this short case study has demonstrated how easy it is to add multithreading to computations with Scala parallel sequences, and some considerations for making the best use of available threads.  Happy Parallel Programming!</p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/03/31/hygienic-closures-for-scala-function-serialization/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-31T06:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/03/31/hygienic-closures-for-scala-function-serialization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In most use cases of Scala closures, what you see is what you get, but there are exceptions where looks can be deceiving and this can have a big impact on closure serialization.  Closure serialization is of more than academic interest.  Tools like Apache Spark cannot operate without serializing functions over the network.  In this post I'll describe some scenarios where closures include more than what is evident in the code, and then a technique for preventing unwanted inclusions.</p>

<p>To establish a bit of context, consider this simple example that obtains a function and serializes it to disk, and which <em>does</em> behave as expected:</p>

<pre><code>object Demo extends App {
  def write[A](obj: A, fname: String) {
    import java.io._
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fname)).writeObject(obj)
  }

  object foo {
    val v = 42
    // The returned function includes 'v' in its closure
    def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
  }

  // The function 'f' will serialize as expected
  val f = foo.f
  write(f, "/tmp/demo.f")
}
</code></pre>

<p>When this app is compiled and run, it will serialize <code>f</code> to "/tmp/demo.f1", which of course includes the value of <code>v</code> as part of the closure for <code>f</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /tmp closures.scala
$ scala -cp /tmp Demo
$ ls /tmp/demo*
/tmp/demo.f
</code></pre>

<p>Now, imagine you wanted to make a straightforward change, where <code>object foo</code> becomes <code>class foo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>object Demo extends App {
  def write[A](obj: A, fname: String) {
    import java.io._
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fname)).writeObject(obj)
  }

  // foo is a class instead of an object
  class foo() {
    val v = 42
    // The returned function includes 'v' in its closure, but also a secret surprise
    def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
  }

  // This will throw an exception!
  val f = new foo().f
  write(f, "/tmp/demo.f")
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would be reasonable to expect that this minor variation behaves exactly as the previous one, but instead it throws an exception!</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /tmp closures.scala
$ scala -cp /tmp Demo
java.io.NotSerializableException: Demo$foo
</code></pre>

<p>If we look at the exception message, we see that it's complaining about not knowing how to serialize objects of class <code>foo</code>.  But we weren't including any values of <code>foo</code> in the closure for <code>f</code>, only a particular member 'v'!  What gives?  Scala is not very helpful with diagnosing this problem, but when a class member value shows up in a closure that is defined <em>inside</em> the class body, the <em>entire instance</em>, including any and all other member values, is included in the closure.  Presumably this is because a class may have any number of instances, and the compiler is including the entire instance in the closure to properly resolve the correct member value.</p>

<p>One straightforward way to fix this is to simply make class <code>foo</code> serializable:</p>

<pre><code>class foo() extends Serializable {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you make this change to the above code, the example with <code>class foo</code> now works correctly, but it is working by serializing the entire <code>foo</code> instance, not just the value of <code>v</code>.</p>

<p>In many cases, this is not a problem and will work fine.  Serializing a few additional members may be inexpensive.  In other cases, however, it can be an impractical or impossible option.  For example, <code>foo</code> might include other very large members, which will be expensive or outright impossible to serialize:</p>

<pre><code>class foo() extends Serializable {
  val v = 42    // easy to serialize
  val w = 4.5   // easy to serialize
  val data = (1 to 1000000000).toList  // serialization landmine hiding in your closure

  // The returned function includes all of 'foo' instance in its closure
  def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
}
</code></pre>

<p>A variation on the above problem is class members that are small or moderate in size, but serialized many times.  In this case, the serialization cost can become intractable via repetition of unwanted inclusions.</p>

<p>Another potential problem is class members that are not serializable, and perhaps not under your control:</p>

<pre><code>class foo() extends Serializable {
  import some.class.NotSerializable

  val v = 42                      // easy to serialize
  val x = new NotSerializable     // I'll hide in your closure and fail to serialize

  // The returned function includes all of 'foo' instance in its closure
  def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a relatively painless way to decouple values from their parent instance, so that only desired values are included in a closure.  Passing desired values as parameters to a shim function whose job is to assemble the closure will prevent the parent instance from being pulled into the closure.  In the following example, a shim function named <code>closureFunction</code> is defined for this purpose:</p>

<pre><code>object Demo extends App {
  def write[A](obj: A, fname: String) {
    import java.io._
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fname)).writeObject(obj)
  }

  // apply a generator to create a function with safe decoupled closures
  def closureFunction[E,D,R](enclosed: E)(gen: E =&gt; (D =&gt; R)) = gen(enclosed)

  class NotSerializable {}

  class foo() {
    val v1 = 42
    val v2 = 73
    val n = new NotSerializable

    // use shim function to enclose *only* the values of 'v1' and 'v2'
    def f() = closureFunction((v1, v2)) { enclosed =&gt;
      val (v1, v2) = enclosed
      (x: Int) =&gt; (v1 + v2) * x   // Desired function, with 'v1' and 'v2' enclosed
    }
  }

  // This will work!
  val f = new foo().f
  write(f, "/tmp/demo.f")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Being aware of the scenarios where parent instances are pulled into closures, and how to keep your closures clean, can save some frustration and wasted time.  Happy programming!</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/01/24/monadic-break-and-continue-for-scala-sequence-comprehensions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Author's note: I've since received some excellent feedback from the Scala community, which I included in some <a href="#notes">end notes</a>.</p>

<p>Author's note the 2nd: I later realized I could apply an implicit conversion and mediator class to preserve the traditional ordering: the code has been updated with that approach.</p>

<p>Author's note the 3rd: This concept has been submitted to the Scala project as JIRA <a href="https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9120">SI-9120</a> (PR <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4275">#4275</a>)</p>

<p>Scala <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/sequence-comprehensions.html">sequence comprehensions</a> are an excellent functional programming idiom for looping in Scala.  However, sequence comprehensions encompass much more than just looping -- they represent a powerful syntax for manipulating <em>all</em> monadic structures<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> looping constructs are a popular framework for cleanly representing multiple loop halting and continuation conditions at differing stages in the execution flow.  Although there is no native support for <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> in Scala control constructs, it is possible to implement them in a clean and idiomatic way for sequence comprehensions.</p>

<p>In this post I will describe a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> for use in Scala sequence comprehensions (aka <code>for</code> statements).  The entire implementation is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>object BreakableGenerators {
  import scala.language.implicitConversions

  type Generator[+A] = Iterator[A]
  type BreakableGenerator[+A] = BreakableIterator[A]

  // Generates a new breakable generator from any traversable object.
  def breakable[A](t1: TraversableOnce[A]): Generator[BreakableGenerator[A]] =
    List(new BreakableIterator(t1.toIterator)).iterator

  // Mediates boolean expression with 'break' and 'continue' invocations
  case class BreakableGuardCondition(cond: Boolean) {
    // Break the looping over one or more breakable generators, if 'cond' 
    // evaluates to true.
    def break(b: BreakableGenerator[_], bRest: BreakableGenerator[_]*): Boolean = {
      if (cond) {
        b.break
        for (x &lt;- bRest) { x.break }
      }
      !cond
    }

    // Continue to next iteration of enclosing generator if 'cond' 
    // evaluates to true.
    def continue: Boolean = !cond
  }

  // implicit conversion of boolean values to breakable guard condition mediary
  implicit def toBreakableGuardCondition(cond: Boolean) =
    BreakableGuardCondition(cond)

  // An iterator that can be halted via its 'break' method.  Not invoked directly
  class BreakableIterator[+A](itr: Iterator[A]) extends Iterator[A] {
    private var broken = false
    private[BreakableGenerators] def break { broken = true }

    def hasNext = !broken &amp;&amp; itr.hasNext
    def next = itr.next
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The approach is based on a simple subclass of <code>Iterator</code> -- <code>BreakableIterator</code> -- that can be halted by 'breaking' it.  The function <code>breakable(&lt;traversable-object&gt;)</code> returns an Iterator over a single <code>BreakableIterator</code> object.  Iterators are monad-like structures in that they implement <code>map</code> and <code>flatMap</code>, and so its output can be used with <code>&lt;-</code> at the start of a <code>for</code> construct in the usual way.  Note that this means the result of the <code>for</code> statement will also be an Iterator.</p>

<p>Whenever the boolean expression for an <code>if</code> guard is followed by either <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code>, it is implicitly converted to a "breakable guard condition" that supports those methods.  The function <code>break</code> accepts one or more instances of <code>BreakableIterator</code>.  If it evaluates to <code>true</code>, the loops embodied by the given iterators are immediately halted via the associated <code>if</code> guard, and the iterators are halted via their <code>break</code> method.  The <code>continue</code> function is mostly syntactic sugar for a standard <code>if</code> guard, simply with the condition inverted.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> in use:</p>

<pre><code>object Main {
  import BreakableGenerators._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val r = for (
      // generate a breakable sequence from some sequential input
      loop &lt;- breakable(1 to 1000);
      // iterate over the breakable sequence
      j &lt;- loop;
      // print out at each iteration
      _ = { println(s"iteration j= $j") };
      // continue to next iteration when 'j' is even
      if { j % 2 == 0 } continue;
      // break out of the loop when 'j' exceeds 5
      if { j &gt; 5 } break(loop)
    ) yield {
      j
    }
    println(s"result= ${r.toList}")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can see from the resulting output that <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> function in the usual way.  The <code>continue</code> clause ignores all subsequent code when <code>j</code> is even.  The <code>break</code> clause halts the loop when it sees its first value > 5, which is 7.  Only odd values &lt;= 5 are output from the <code>yield</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /home/eje/class monadic_break.scala
$ scala -classpath /home/eje/class Main
iteration j= 1
iteration j= 2
iteration j= 3
iteration j= 4
iteration j= 5
iteration j= 6
iteration j= 7
result= List(1, 3, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Breakable iterators can be nested in the way one would expect.  The following example shows an inner breakable loop nested inside an outer one:</p>

<pre><code>object Main {
  import BreakableGenerators._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val r = for (
      outer &lt;- breakable(1 to 7);
      j &lt;- outer;
      _ = { println(s"outer  j= $j") };
      if { j % 2 == 0 } continue;
      inner &lt;- breakable(List("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"));
      k &lt;- inner;
      _ = { println(s"    inner  j= $j  k= $k") };
      if { k == "d" } break(inner);
      if { j == 5  &amp;&amp;  k == "c" } break(inner, outer)
    ) yield {
      (j, k)
    }
    println(s"result= ${r.toList}")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output demonstrates that the inner loop breaks whenever <code>k=="d"</code>, and so <code>"e"</code> is never present in the <code>yield</code> result.  When <code>j==5</code> and <code>k=="c"</code>, both the inner and outer loops are broken, and so we see that there is no <code>(5,"c")</code> pair in the result, nor does the outer loop ever iterate over 6 or 7:</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /home/eje/class monadic_break.scala
$ scala -classpath /home/eje/class Main
outer  j= 1
    inner  j= 1  k= a
    inner  j= 1  k= b
    inner  j= 1  k= c
    inner  j= 1  k= d
outer  j= 2
outer  j= 3
    inner  j= 3  k= a
    inner  j= 3  k= b

<p>Using <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> with <code>BreakableIterator</code> for sequence comprehensions is that easy.  Enjoy!</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<p>The helpful community on freenode #scala made some excellent observations:</p>

<p>1: Iterators in Scala are not strictly monadic -- it would be more accurate to say they're "things with a flatMap and map method, also they can use filter or withFilter sometimes."  However, I personally still prefer to think of them as "monadic in spirit if not law."</p>

<p>2: The <code>break</code> function, as described in this post, is not truly functional in the sense of referential transparency, as the invocation <code>if break(loop) { condition }</code> involves a side-effect on the variable <code>loop</code>.  I would say that it does maintain "scoped functionality."  That is, the break in non-referential transparency is scoped by the variables in question.  The <code>for</code> statement containing them is referentially transparent with respect to its inputs (provided no other code is breaking referential transparency, of course).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generating a random sample of a collection is, logically, a O(np) operation, where (n) is the sample size and (p) is the sampling probability.  For example, extracting a random sample, without replacement, from an array might look like this in pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>sample(data: array, p: real) {
    n = length(data)
    m = floor(p * n)
    for j = 0 to m-1 {
        k = random(j, n-1)
        swap(data[j], data[k])
    }
    emit the first m elements of 'data' to output
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that this sampling algorithm is indeed O(np).  However, it makes some nontrivial assumptions about its input data:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is random access</li>
<li>It is writable</li>
<li>Its size is known</li>
<li>It can be destructively modified</li>
</ul>


<p>These assumptions can be violated in several ways.  The input data might not support random access, for example it might be a list, or stream, or an iterator over the same.  We might not know its size a priori.  It might be read-only.  It might be up-cast to some superclass where knowledge about these assumed properties is no longer available.</p>

<p>In cases such as this, there is another common sampling algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    while not end(data) {
        v = next(data)
        if random(0.0, 1.0) &lt; p then emit v to output
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above algorithm enjoys all the advantage in flexibility.  It requires only linear access, does not require writable input, and makes no assumptions about input size.  However it comes at a price: this algorithm is no longer O(np), it is O(n).  Each element must be traversed directly, and worse yet the random number generagor (RNG) must be invoked on each element.  O(n) invocation of the RNG is a substantial cost -- random number generation is typically very expensive compared to the cost of iterating to the next element in a sequence.</p>

<p>But... does linear sampling truly require us to invoke our RNG on every element?   Consider the pattern of data access, divorced from code.   It looks like a sequence of choices: for each element we either (skip) or (sample):</p>

<pre><code>(skip) (skip) (sample) (skip) (sample) (skip) (sample) (sample) (skip) (skip) (sample) ...
</code></pre>

<p>The number of consecutive (skip) events between each (sample) -- the <em>sampling gap</em> -- can itself be modeled as a random variable.  Each (skip)/(sample) choice is an independent Bernoulli trial, where the probability of (skip) is (1-p).   The PMF of the sampling gap for gap of {0, 1, 2, ...} is therefore a geometric distribution: P(k) = p(1-p)<sup>k</sup></p>

<p>This suggests an alternative algorithm for sampling, where we only need to randomly choose sample gaps instead of randomly choosing whether we sample each individual element:</p>

<pre><code>// choose a random sampling gap 'k' from P(k) = p(1-p)^k
// caution: this explodes for p = 0 or p = 1
random_gap(p: real) {
    u = max(random(0.0, 1.0), epsilon)
    return floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
}

sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    advance(data, random_gap(p))
    while not end(data) {
        emit next(data) to output
        advance(data, random_gap(p))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above algorithm calls the RNG only once per actual collected sample, and so the cost of RNG calls is O(np).  Note that the algorithm is still O(n), but the cost of the RNG tends to dominate the cost of sequence traversal, and so the resulting efficiency improvement is substantial.  I measured the following performance improvements with gap sampling, compared to traditional linear sequence sampling, on a <a href="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/05db1f15c8d623448ff6">Scala prototype testing rig</a>:</p>

<p>In the results above, we see that the gap sampling times are essentially linear in (p), as expected.  In the case of the linear-access List type, there is a higher baseline time (230 vs 29) due to the constant cost of actual data traversal.  Efficiency improvements are substantial at small sampling probabilities.</p>

<p>We can also see that the cost of gap sampling begins to meet and then exceed the cost of traditinal linear sampling, in the vicinnity (p) = 0.5.  This is due to the fact that the gap sampling logic is about twice the cost (in my test environment) of simply calling the RNG once.  For example, the gap sampling invokes a call to the numeric logarithm code that isn't required in traditional sampling.  And so at (p) = 0.5 the time spent doing the gap sampling approximates the time spent invoking the RNG once per sample, and at higher values of (p) the cost is greater.</p>

<p>This suggests that one should in fact fall back to traditional linear sampling when the sampling probability (p) >= some threshold.  That threshold appears to be about 0.5 or 0.6 in my testing rig, but is likely to depend on underlying numeric libraries, the particular RNG being used, etc, and so I would expect it to benefit from customized tuning on a per-environment basis.  With this in mind, a sample algorithm as deployed would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// threshold is a tuning parameter
threshold = 0.5

sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    if (p &lt; threshold) {
        gap_sample(data, p)
    } else {
        traditional_linear_sample(data, p)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The gap-sampling algorithm described above is for sampling <em>without</em> replacement.   However, the same approach can be modified to generate sampling <em>with</em> replacement.</p>

<p>When sampling with replacement, it is useful to consider the <em>replication factor</em> of each element (where a replication factor of zero means the element wasn't sampled).  Pretend for the moment that the actual data size (n) is known.  The sample size (m) = (n)(p).  The probability that each element gets sampled, per trial, is 1/n, with (m) independent trials, and so the replication factor (r) for each element obeys a binomial distribution: Binomial(m, 1/n).  If we substitute (n)(p) for (m), we have Binomial(np, 1/n).  As the (n) grows, the Binomial is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Poisson_approximation">well approximated by a Poisson distribution</a> Poisson(L), where (L) = (np)(1/n) = (p).  And so for our purposes we may sample from Poisson(p), where P(r) = (p<sup>r</sup> / r!)e<sup>(-p),</sup> for our sampling replication factors.  Note that we have now discarded any dependence on sample size (n), as we desire.</p>

<p>In our gap-sampling context, the sampling gaps are now elements whose replication factor is zero, which occurs with probability P(0) = e<sup>(-p).</sup>  And so our sampling gaps are now drawn from geometric distribution P(k) = (1-q)(q)<sup>k,</sup> where q = e<sup>(-p).</sup>   When we <em>do</em> sample an element, its replication factor is drawn from Poisson(p), however <em>conditioned such that the value is >= 1.</em>  It is straightforward to adapt a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Generating_Poisson-distributed_random_variables">standard Poisson generator</a>, as shown below.</p>

<p>Given the above, gap sampling with replacement in pseudocode looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// sample 'k' from Poisson(p), conditioned to k &gt;= 1
poisson_ge1(p: real) {
    q = e^(-p)
    // simulate a poisson trial such that k &gt;= 1
    t = q + (1-q)*random(0.0, 1.0)
    k = 1

    // continue standard poisson generation trials
    t = t * random(0.0, 1.0)
    while (t &gt; q) {
        k = k + 1
        t = t * random(0.0, 1.0)
    }
    return k
}

// choose a random sampling gap 'k' from P(k) = p(1-p)^k
// caution: this explodes for p = 0 or p = 1
random_gap(p: real) {
    u = max(random(0.0, 1.0), epsilon)
    return floor(log(u) / -p)
}

sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    advance(data, random_gap(p))
    while not end(data) {
        rf = poisson_ge1(p)
        v = next(data)
        emit (rf) copies of (v) to output
        advance(data, random_gap(p))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As with the results for sampling without replacement, we see that gap sampling cost is linear with (p), which yields large cost savings at small sampling, but begins to exceed traditional linear sampling at higher sampling probabilities.</p>
