    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_1Introduction.html#8555">HTCondor negotiator</a> assigns jobs (resource requests) to slots (compute resources) at regular intervals, configured by the <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_3Configuration.html#20544">NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL</a> parameter.  This interval (the cycle <em>cadence</em>) has a fundamental impact on a pool <em>loading factor</em> -- the fraction of time that slots are being productively utilized.</p>

<p>Consider the following diagram, which illustrates the utilization of a slot over the lifetime of a job.  When a job completes, its slot will remain empty until it can be assigned a new job on the next negotiation cycle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/slot_load_study/loading_factor_diagram.png" width="750"></p>

<p>As the diagram above shows, the loading factor for a slot can be expressed as D/Z, where D is the duration of the job, and Z is the total time until the next cycle occurring after the job completes.  We can also write Z = D+I, where I is the "idle time" from job completion to the start of the next negotiation cycle.   Loading factor is always &lt;= 1, where a value of 1 corresponds to ideal loading -- every slot is utilized 100% of the time.  In general, loading will be &lt; 1, as jobs rarely complete exactly on a cycle boundary.</p>

<p>It is worth briefly noting that the <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/3_3Configuration.html#18202">claim reuse</a> feature was developed to help address this problem.  However, claim re-use is not compatible with all other features -- for example enabling claim re-use can cause accounting group starvation -- and so what follows remains relevant to many HTCondor configurations.</p>

<p>Given a particular negotiation cycle cadence, how does a slot's loading factor behave, as a function of job duration?  The loading factor can be expressed as:</p>

<div markdown="0">
\\[
\\text{Loading Factor} = \\frac{D}{C \\left( q + \\lceil r \\rceil \\right)} \\\\
 \\\\
\\text{where:} \\\\
D = \\text{job duration} \\\\
C = \\text{cycle cadence} \\\\
q = \\lfloor D / C \\rfloor \\\\
r = \\left( D / C \\right) - q \\\\
\\]
</div>


<p>The following plot illustrates how the loading factor changes with job duration, assuming a cadence of 300 seconds (5 minutes):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/slot_load_study/load_factor_300s.png" width="750"></p>

<p>We immediately see that there is a saw-tooth pattern to the plot.  As the job duration increases towards the boundary of a cycle, there is less and less idle time until the next cycle, and so the loading approaches 1.0.  However, once the job's end crosses the thresold to <em>just past</em> the start of the cycle, it immediately drops to the worse possible case: the slot will be idle for nearly an entire cycle.</p>

<p>The other important pattern is that the bottom of the saw-tooth gradually increases.  As a job's duration occupies more whole negotiation cycles, the idle time at the end of the last cycle represents a decreasing fraction of the total time.</p>

<p>Observe that the most important 'unit' in this plot is the number of negotiation cycles.  Since the saw-toothing scales with the cycle interval, we can express the same plot in units of cycles instead of seconds:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/slot_load_study/load_factor_cu.png" width="750"></p>

<p>The results above suggest a couple possible approaches for tuning negotiator cycle cadence to optimize slot loading in an HTCondor pool.  The first is to configure the negotiator interval to be small relative to a typical job duration, as the lower-bound on loading factor increases with the number of cycles a job's duration occupies.  For example, if a typical job duration is 10 minutes, then a cycle cadence of 60 seconds ensures that in general 9 out of 10 cycles will be fully utilized, and so loading will be around 90%.  However, if one has mostly very short jobs, this can be difficult, as negotiation cycle cadences much less than 60 seconds may risk causing performance problems even on a moderately loaded pool.</p>

<p>A second approach is to try and tune the cadence so that as many jobs as possible complete <em>near the end</em> of a cycle, thus minimizing delay until the next cycle.  For example, if job durations are relatively consistent, say close to 90 seconds, then setting the negotiator interval to something like 50 seconds will induce those jobs to finish near the end of the 2nd negotiation cycle (at t+100 seconds), for a loading factor around 90%.  The caveat here is that job durations are frequently <em>not</em> that consistent, and as job duration spread increases, one's ability to play this game <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2013/03/15/examining-the-modulus-of-random-variables/">rapidly evaporates</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, I have focused on the behavior of individual jobs and individual slots.  An obvious next question is what happens to aggregate pool loading when job durations are treated as population sampling from random variables, which I plan to explore in future posts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HTCondor supports a notion of aggregate compute resources known as partitionable slots (p-slots), which may be consumed by multiple jobs.   Historically, at most one job could be matched against such a slot in a single negotiation cycle, which limited the rate at which partitionable slot resources could be utilized.  More recently, the scheduler has been enhanced with logic to allow it to acquire multiple claims against a partitionable slot, which increases the p-slot utilization rate. However, as this potentially bypasses the negotiator's accounting of global pool resources such as accounting group quotas and concurrency limits, it places some contraints on what jobs can can safely acquire multiple claims against any particular p-slot: for example, only other jobs on the same scheduler can be considered.  Additionally, candidate job requirements must match the requirements of the job that originally matched in the negotiator.  Another significant impact is that the negotiator is still forced to match an entire p-slot, which may have a large match cost (weight): these large match costs cause <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">accounting difficulties</a> when submitter shares and/or group quotas drop below the cost of a slot.  This particular problem is growing steadily larger, as machines with ever-larger numbers of cores and other resources appear in HTCondor pools.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to scheduler-side resource consumption is to enhance the negotiator with the ability to match multiple jobs against a resource (p-slot) -- negotiator-side resource consumption.   The advantages of negotiator-side consumption are that it places fewer limitations on what jobs can consume a given resource.  The negotiator already handles global resource accounting, and so jobs are not required to adhere to the same requirements expression to safely consume assets from the same resource.  Furthermore, jobs from any scheduler may be considered.  Each match is only charged the cost of resources consumed, and so p-slots with large amounts of resources do not cause difficulties with large match costs.   Another considerable benefit of this approach is that it facilitates the support of <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/no-longer-thinking-in-slots-thinking-in-aggregate-resources-and-consumption-policies/">configurable resource consumption policies</a></p>

<p>I have developed a working draft of negotiator-side resource consumption on my HTCondor github fork, topic branch <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/htcondor/tree/V7_9-prototype-negside-pslot-splits">V7_9-prototype-negside-pslot-splits</a> which also implements support for configurable resource consumption policies.   I will briefly demonstrate this implementation and some of its advantages below.</p>

<p>First I will demonstrate an example with a consumption policy that is essentially equivalent to HTCondor's current default policies.  Consider this configuration:</p>

<pre><code># spoof some cores
NUM_CPUS = 10

# configure an aggregate resource (p-slot) to consume
SLOT_TYPE_1 = 100%
SLOT_TYPE_1_PARTITIONABLE = True
# declare multiple claims for negotiator to use
# may also use global: NUM_CLAIMS
SLOT_TYPE_1_NUM_CLAIMS = 20
NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 1

# turn off schedd-side resource splitting since we're demonstrating neg-side alternative
CLAIM_PARTITIONABLE_LEFTOVERS = False

# turn this off to demonstrate that consumption policy will handle this kind of logic
MUST_MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS = False

# configure a consumption policy.   This policy is modeled on
# current 'modify-request-exprs' defaults:
# "my" is resource ad, "target" is job ad
STARTD_EXPRS = ConsumptionCpus, ConsumptionMemory, ConsumptionDisk
ConsumptionCpus = quantize(target.RequestCpus, {1})
ConsumptionMemory = quantize(target.RequestMemory, {128})
ConsumptionDisk = quantize(target.RequestDisk, {1024})
# swap doesn't seem to be actually supported in resource accounting

# keep slot weights enabled for match costing
NEGOTIATOR_USE_SLOT_WEIGHTS = True

# weight used to derive match cost: W(before-consumption) - W(after-consumption)
SlotWeight = Cpus

# for simplicity, turn off preemption, caching, worklife
CLAIM_WORKLIFE=0
MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME = 3600
PREEMPT = False
RANK = 0
PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS = False
NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION = False
NEGOTIATOR_MATCHLIST_CACHING = False

# verbose logging
ALL_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG

# reduce daemon update latencies
NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL = 30
SCHEDD_INTERVAL = 15
</code></pre>

<p>In the above configuration, we declare a typical aggregate (that is, partitionable) resource <code>SLOT_TYPE_1</code>, but then we also configure a <em>consumption policy</em>, by advertising <code>ConsumptionCpus</code>, <code>ConsumptionMemory</code> and <code>ConsumptionDisk</code>.  Note that these are defined with quantizing expressions currently used as default values for the <code>MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS</code> behavior.  The startd and the negotiatior will <em>both</em> use these expressions by examining the slot ads.</p>

<p>Next, we submit 15 jobs.  Note that this more than the 10 cores advertised by the p-slot:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = 60
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
queue 15
</code></pre>

<p>If we watch the negotiator log, we will see that negotiator matches the 10 jobs supported by the p-slot on the next cycle (note that it uses slot1 each time):</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-'  -e 'matched
12/03/12 11:53:10 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 11:53:25 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 11:53:25 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>condor_q</code> to verify that the 10 jobs subsequently run.   The jobs run against 10 dynamic slots (d-slots) in the standard way:</p>

<pre><code>$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotCpus
slot1@rorschach | 10
slot1_10@rorschach | 1
slot1_1@rorschach | 1
slot1_2@rorschach | 1
slot1_3@rorschach | 1
slot1_4@rorschach | 1
slot1_5@rorschach | 1
slot1_6@rorschach | 1
slot1_7@rorschach | 1
slot1_8@rorschach | 1
slot1_9@rorschach | 1
</code></pre>

<p>Next we consider altering the resource consumption policy.  As a simple example, suppose we wish to allocate memory more coarsely.  We could alter the configuration above by changing <code>ConsumptionMemory</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>ConsumptionMemory = quantize(target.RequestMemory, {512})
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps we then also want to express match cost in a memory-centric way, instead of the usual cpu-centric way:</p>

<pre><code>SlotWeight = floor(Memory / 512)
</code></pre>

<p>Here it is worth noting that in this implementation of negotiator-side consumption, the cost of a match is defined as W(S) - W(S'), where W(S) is the weight of the slot <em>prior</em> to consuming resources from the match and consumption policy, and W(S`) is the weight evaluated for the slot <em>after</em> those resources are subtracted.  This modification enables multiple matches to be made against a single p-slot, and furthermore it paves the way to possible avenues for a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/26/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-computing-claim-capacity-from-consumption-policy/">better unit analysis of slot weights and accounting groups</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing the example, if we re-run the example with this new consumption policy, we should see that memory limits reduce the number of jobs matched against <code>slot1</code> to 3:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-'  -e 'matched'
12/03/12 12:58:22 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 12:58:37 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 12:58:37 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
</code></pre>

<p>Examining the slot memory assets, we see that there is insufficient memory for a fourth match when our consumption policy sets the minimum at 512:</p>

<pre><code>$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotMemory
slot1@rorschach | 1903
slot1_1@rorschach | 512
slot1_2@rorschach | 512
slot1_3@rorschach | 512
</code></pre>

<p>As a final example, I'll demonstrate the positive impact of negotiator side matching on interactions with accounting groups (or submitter shares).  Again returning to my original example, modify the configuration with a simple accounting group policy:</p>

<pre><code>GROUP_NAMES = a
GROUP_QUOTA_a = 1
GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS = False
GROUP_AUTOREGROUP = False
</code></pre>

<p>Now submit 2 jobs against accounting group <code>a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>universe = vanilla
cmd = /bin/sleep
args = 60
should_transfer_files = if_needed
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
+AccountingGroup="a.u"
queue 2
</code></pre>

<p>We see that accounting groups are respected: one job runs, and it does not suffer from insufficient share to acquire resources from <code>slot1</code> <a href="https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3013">(GT3013)</a>, because match cost is computed using only the individual job's impact on slot weight, instead of being required to match the entire p-slot:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f ~/condor/local/log/NegotiatorLog | grep -e '\-\-\-\-\-' -e matched
12/03/12 14:57:50 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 14:58:08 ---------- Started Negotiation Cycle ----------
12/03/12 14:58:08       Successfully matched with slot1@rorschach
12/03/12 14:58:09 ---------- Finished Negotiation Cycle ----------

$ ccdump condor_status Name TotalSlotCpus
slot1@rorschach | 10
slot1_1@rorschach | 1
</code></pre>
