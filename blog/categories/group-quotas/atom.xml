    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In two previous posts, I made a case to motivate the need for a better definition of slot weights and group quotas that could accommodate use cases involving aggregate resources (partitionable slots) with heterogeneous consumption policies and also provide a principled unit analysis for weights and quotas.  These previous posts can be viewed here:</p>

</ul>


<p>As previously mentioned, a Claim Capacity Model of accounting group quotas and slot weights (or "resource consumption costs") requires a resource claiming model that assigns a well defined finite value for the maximum number of claims that each resource and its consumption policy can support.  It must also be re-evaluatable on a resource as its assets are consumed, so that the cost of a proposed claim (or match, in negotiation-speak) can be defined as W(R) - W(R'), were R' embodies the amounts of all assets remaining after the claim has taken its share.  (Here, I will be using the term 'assets' to refer to quantities such as cpus, memory, disk, swap or any <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/extensible-machine-resources/">extensible resources</a> defined, to clarify the difference between an aggregate resource (i.e. a partitionable slot) versus a single resource dimension such as cpus, memory, etc).</p>

<p>This almost immediately raises the question of how best to define such a resource claiming model.  In this post I will briefly describe a few possible approaches, focusing on models which are easy reason about, easy to configure and additionally allow claim capacity for a resource - W(R) - to be computed automatically for the user, thus making a sane relationship between consumption policies and consumption costs possible to enforce.</p>

<h3>Approach 1: fixed claim consumption model</h3>

<p>The simplest-possible approach is arguably to just directly configure a fixed number, M, of claims attached to a resource.  In this model, each match of a job against a resource consumes one of the M claims.   Here, match cost W(R) - W(R') = 1 in all cases, and is independent of the 'size' of assets consumed from a resource.</p>

<p>A possible use case for such a model is that one might wish to declare that a resource can run up to a certain number of jobs, without assigning any particular cost to consuming individual assets.  If the pool users' workload consists of large numbers of resource-cheap jobs that can effectively share cpu, memory, etc, then such a model might be a good fit.</p>

<h3>Approach 2: configure asset quantization levels</h3>

<p>Another approach that makes the relation between consumption policy and claim capacity easy to think about is to configure a quantization level for each resource asset.  For example, here we might quantize memory into 20 levels, i.e. Q(memory) = 20.  Similarly we might define Q(cpus) = 10 (note that HTCondor does not currently handle fractional cpus on resources, but this kind of model would benefit if floating point asset fractions were supported).  At any time, a resource R has some number q(a) left of the original Q(a).  A job requests an amount r(a) for asset (a).   Here, a claim gets a quantized approximation of any requested asset = V(a)(n(a)/Q(a)), where V(a) is the total original value available for asset (a), and n(a) = ceiling(r(a)Q(a)/V(a)).   Here there are two possible sub-policies.  If we demand that each claim consume >= 1 quantum of every asset (i.e. n(a) >= 1), then the claim capacity W(R) is the minimum of q(a), for (a) over all assets.  However, if a claim is allowed to consume a zero quantity of some individual assets (n(a)=0), then the claim capacity is the <em>maximum</em> of the q(a).   In this case, one must address the corner case of a claim attempting to consume (n(a)=0) over all assets.  The resulting resource R' has q'(a) = q(a)-n(a), and W(R') is the minium (or maximum) over the new q'(a).</p>

<h3>Approach 3: configure minimum asset charges</h3>

<p>A third approach is to configure a <em>minimum</em> amount of each asset that any claim must be charged.   For example, we might define a minimum amount of memory C(memory) to charge any claim.   If a job requests an amount r(a), it will always receive max(r(a), C(a)).  As above, q(a) is the number of quanta currently available for asset (a).  Let v(a) be the amount of (a) currently available.  Here we define q(a) for an asset (a) to be floor(v(a)/C(a)).   If we adhere to a reasonable restriction that C(a) must be strictly > 0 for all (a), we are guaranteed a well defined W(R) = min over the q(a).</p>

<p>It is an open question which of these models (or some other completely different options) should be supported.  Conceivably all of them could be provided as options.</p>

<p>Currently my personal preference leans toward Approach 3.  It is easy to reason about and configure.  It yields a well defined W(R) in all circumstances, with no corner cases, that is straightforward to compute and enforce automatically.  It is easy to configure heterogeneous consumption policies that cost different resource assets in different ways, simply by tuning minimum charge C(a) appropriately for each asset.  This includes claim capacity models where jobs are assumed to use very small amounts of any resource, including fractional shares of cpu assets.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post about <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2012/11/13/rethinking-the-semantics-of-group-quotas-and-slot-weights-for-heterogeneous-and-multidimensional-compute-resources">Rethinking the Semantics of Group Quotas and Slot Weights</a>, I proposed a concept for unifying the semantics of accounting group quotas and slot weights across arbitrary resource allocation strategies.</p>

<p>My initial terminology was that the weight of a slot (i.e. resource ad) is a measure of the <em>maximum</em> number of jobs that might match against that ad, given the currently available resource quantities and the allocation policy.  The cost of a match becomes the amount by which that measure is reduced, after the match's resources are removed from the ad.</p>

<p>In the HTCondor vocabulary, a job acquires a <em>claim</em> on resources to actually run after it has been matched.  It has been proposed that it may be beneficial for HTCondor to evolve toward a model where there are (aggregate) resource ads, and claims against those ads, as a simplification of the current model which involves static, partitionable and dynamic slots, with claims.  With this in mind, a preferable terminology for group quota and weight semantics might be that a resource ad (or slot) has a measure of the maximum number of claims it could dispense: a <em>claim capacity</em> measure.  The cost of a claim (or match) is the corresponding reduction of the resource's claim capacity.</p>

<p>So, this semantic model could be referred to as the Claim Capacity Model of group quotas and slot weights.  With this terminology, the shared 'unit' for group quotas and slot weights would be <em>claims</em> instead of <em>jobs</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The HTCondor semantic for accounting group quotas and slot weights is currently cpu-centric.  This is an artifact of the historic primacy of cpu as the most commonly-considered limiting resource in computations.  For example the <code>SlotWeight</code> attribute is currently defaulted to <code>Cpus</code>, and when slot weights are disabled, there is logic activated in matchmaking to sum the available cpus on slots to avoid 'undercounting' total pool quotas.</p>

<p>However, HTCondor slots -- the core model of computational resources in an HTCondor pool -- manage four resources by default: cpu, memory, disk and swap.  Furthermore, slots may now be configured with arbitrary custom resources.  As recently mentioned by <a href="http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/no-longer-thinking-in-slots-thinking-in-aggregate-resources-and-consumption-policies">Matthew Farrellee</a>, there is a growing pressure to provide robust support not just for traditional cpu-centric resource presentation, usage and allocation, but also seamlessly mediated with memory-centric, gpu-centric or '*'-centric resource allocation policies and more generally allocation policies that are simultaneously aware of all resource dimensions.</p>

<p>This goal immediately raises some questions for the semantics of accounting groups and slot weights when matching jobs against slots during matchmaking.</p>

<p>Consider a pool where 50% of the slots are 'weighted' in a traditional cpu-centric way, but the other 50% are intended to be allocated in a memory-centric way.  This is currently possible, as the <code>SlotWeight</code> attribute can be configured appropriately to be a function of either <code>Cpus</code> or <code>Memory</code>.</p>

<p>But in a scenario where slots are weighted as functions of heterogeneous resource dimensions, it raises a semantic question:  when we sum these weights to obtain the pool-wide available quota, what 'real world' quantity does this total represent -- if any?   Is it a purely heuristic numeric value with no well defined unit attached?</p>

<p>This question has import.  Understanding what the answer is, or should be, impacts what story we tell to users about what their accounting group configuration actually means.  When I assign a quota to an accounting group in such a heterogeneous environment, what is that quota regulating?   When a job matches a cpu-centric slot, does the cost of that match have a different meaning than when matching against a memory-centric slot?   When the slots are partitionable, a match implies a certain multi-dimensional slice of resources allocated from that slot.  What is the cost of that slice?  Does the sum of costs add up to the original weight on the partitionable slot?  If not, how does that affect our understanding of quota semantics?</p>

<p>It may be possible unify all of these ideas by adopting the perspective that a slot's weight is a measure of the maximum number of jobs that can be matched against it.  The cost of a match is W(S)-W(S'), where W(S) is the weight function evaluated on the slot prior to match, and W(S') is the corresponding weight after the match has extracted its requested resources.  The pool's total quota is just the sum of W(S), over all slots S in the pool.  Note, this implies that the 'unit' attached to both slot weights and accounting group quotas is 'jobs'.</p>

<p>Consider a simple example from the traditional cpu-centric configuration:   A partitionable slot is configured with 8 cpus, and <code>SlotWeight</code> is just its default <code>Cpus</code>.  Using this model, the allocation policy is: 'each match must use >= 1 cpu", and that other resource requests are assumed to be not limiting.  The maximum number of matches is 8 jobs, each requesting 1 cpu.   However, a job might also request 2 cpus.  In this case, note that the cost of the match is 2, since the remaining slot has 6 slots, and so W(S') now evaluates to 6.   So, the cost of the match is how many fewer possible jobs the original slot can support after the match takes its requested resources.</p>

<p>This approach can be applied equally well to a memory-centric strategy, or a disk centric strategy, or a gpu-based strategy, or any combination simultaneously.  All weights evaluate to a value with unit 'jobs'.   All match costs are differences between weights (before and after match), and so their values are also in units of 'jobs'.  Therefore, the semantics of the sum of weights over a pool is always well defined: it is a number of jobs, and spefically a measure of the maximum number of jobs that might match against all the slots in the pool.  When a match acquires resources that reduce this maximum by more than 1 job, that is not in any way inconsistent.  It means the job used resources that might have supported two or more 'smaller' jobs.   This means that accounting group quotas (and submitter shares) also have a well defined unit and semantic, which is 'how many (or what fraction of) the maximum possible jobs is this group guaranteed by my accounting policy'</p>

<p>One implication of this proposed semantic for quotas and weights is that the measure for the maximum number of jobs that may match against any given slot must be some finite number.   It implies that all resource dimensions are quantized in some way by the allocation policy.   This scheme would not support a real-valued resource dimension that had no minimum quantization.  I do not think that this is a very heavy-weight requirement, and in fact we have already been moving in that direction with features such as MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS_xxx.</p>

<p>When a slot's resource allocation policy is defined over all its resources, what bounds this measure of maximum possible matches?  In a case where each job match <em>must</em> use at least one non-zero quantum of each resource dimension, then the limit is the resource with the mimimum quantized levels.   In a case where jobs may request a zero amount of resources, then the limit is the resource with the maximum quantized levels.  (note, it is required that each match use at least one quantum of at least one resource, otherwise the maximum is not properly bounded).</p>
