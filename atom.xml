    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When training a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision tree</a> learning model (or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">ensemble</a> of such models) it is often nice to have a policy for deciding when a tree node can no longer be usefully split.  There are a variety possibilities.  For example, halting when node population size becomes smaller than some threshold is a simple and effective policy.  Another approach is to halt when some measure of node purity fails to increase by some minimum threshold.  <strong>The underlying concept is to have some measure of split <em>quality</em>, and to halt when no candidate split has sufficient quality.</strong></p>

<p>In this post I am going to discuss some advantages to one of my favorite approaches to measuring split quality, which is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">test statistic significance</a> &#8211; aka &#8220;p-value&#8221; &#8211; of the null hypothesis that the left and right sub-populations are the same after the split.  The idea is that if a split is of good quality, then it ought to have caused the sub-populations to the left and right of the split to be <em>meaningfully different</em>.  That is to say: the null hypothesis (that they are the same) should be <em>rejected</em> with high confidence, i.e. a small p-value.  What constitutes &#8220;small&#8221; is always context dependent, but popular p-values from applied statistics are 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, etc.</p>

<p>The remainder of this post is organized in the following sections:</p>

<p><a href="#consistency">Consistency</a> <br>
<a href="#awareness">Awareness of Sample Sizes</a> <br>
<a href="#results">Training Results</a> <br>
<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a> <br></p>

<p><a name="consistency"></a></p>

<h5>Consistency</h5>

<p>Test statistic p-values have some appealing properties as a split quality measure.  The test statistic methodology has the advantage of working essentially the same way regardless of the particular test being used.  We begin with two sample populations; in our case, these are the left and right sub-populations created by a candidate split.  We want to assess whether these two populations have the same distribution (the null hypothesis) or different distributions.  We measure some test statistic &#8216;S&#8217; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">Student&#8217;s t</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test#Example_chi-squared_test_for_categorical_data">Chi-Squared</a>, etc).  We then compute the probability that |S| >= the value we actually measured.  This probability is commonly referred to as the p-value.  The smaller the p-value, the less likely it is that our two populations are the same.  <strong>In our case, we can interpret this as: a smaller p-value indicates a better quality split.</strong></p>

<p>This consistent methodology has a couple advantages contributing to user experience (UX).  If all measures of split quality work in the same way, then there is a lower cognitive load to move between measures once the user understands the common pattern of use.  A second advantage is better &#8220;unit analysis.&#8221;  Since all such quality measures take the form of p-values, there is no risk of a chosen quality measure getting mis-aligned with a corresponding quality threshold.  They are all probabilities, on the interval [0,1], and &#8220;smaller threshold&#8221; always means &#8220;higher threshold of split quality.&#8221;   By way of comparison, if an application is measuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29">entropy</a> and then switches to using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity">Gini impurity</a>, these measures are in differing units and care has to be taken that the correct quality threshold is used in each case or the model training policy will be broken.  Switching between differing statistical tests does not come with the same risk.  <strong>A p-value quality threshold will have the same semantic regardless of which statistical test is being applied:</strong> probability that left and right sub-populations are the same, given the particular statistic being measured.</p>

<p><a name="awareness"></a></p>

<h5>Awareness of Sample Size</h5>

<p>Test statistics have another appealing property: many are &#8220;aware&#8221; of sample size in a way that captures the idea that the smaller the sample size, the larger the difference between populations should be to conclude a given significance.  For one example, consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch's_t-test#Statistical_test">Welch&#8217;s t-test</a>, the two-sample variation of the t distribution that applies well to comparing left and right sub populations of candidate decision tree splits:</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/pval_halting/figure_1.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Visualizing the effects of sample sizes n1 and n2 on these equations directly is a bit tricky, but assuming equal sample sizes and variances allows the equations to be simplified quite a bit, so that we can observe the effect of sample size:</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/pval_halting/figure_2.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>These simplified equations show clearly that (all else remaining equal) as sample size grows smaller, the measured t-statistic correspondingly grows smaller (proportional to sqrt(n)), and furthermore the corresponding variance of the t distribution to be applied grows larger.  For any given shift in left and right sub-populations, each of these trends yields a larger (i.e. weaker) p-value.   This behavior is desirable for a split quality metric.  <strong>The less data there is at a given candidate split, the less confidence there <em>should</em> be in split quality.</strong>  Put another way: we would like to require a larger difference before a split is measured as being good quality when we have less data to work with, and that is exactly the behavior the t-test provides us.</p>

<p><a name="results"></a></p>

<h5>Training Results</h5>

<p>These propreties are pleasing, but it remains to show that test statistics can actually improve decision tree training in practice.  In the following sections I will compare the effects of training with test statstics with other split quality policies based on entropy and gini index.</p>

<p>To conduct these experiments, I modified a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/pval_halting/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/tree/impurity/ChiSquared.scala">local copy</a> of Apache Spark with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test#Example_chi-squared_test_for_categorical_data">Chi-Squared</a> test statistic for comparing categorical distributions.  The demo script, which I ran in <code>spark-shell</code>, can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/pval_halting/pval_demo">here</a>.</p>

<p>I generated an example data set that represents a two-class learning problem, where labels may be 0 or 1.  Each sample has 10 clean binary features, such that if the bit is 1, the probability of the label is 90% 1 and 10% 0.  There are 5 noise features, also binary, which are completely random.   There are 50 samples of each clean feature being on, for a total of 500 samples.   There are also 500 samples where all clean features are 0 and the corresponding labels are 90% 0 and 10% 1.  The total number of samples in the data set is 1000.  The shape of the data is illustrated by the following table:</p>

<p>For the first run I use my customized chi-squared statistic as the split quality measure.  I used a p-value threshold of 0.01 &#8211; that is, I would like my chi-squared test to conclude that the probability of left and right split populations are the same is &lt;= 0.01, or that split will not be used.  Note, this means I can expect that around 1% of the time, it will conclude a split was good, when it was just luck.  This is a reasonable false-positive rate; random forests are by nature robust to noise, including noise in their own split decisions:</p>

<p>The first thing to observe is that <strong>the resulting decision tree used exactly the 10 clean features 0 through 9, and none of the five noise features.</strong>   The tree splits off each of the clean features to obtain an optimally accurate leaf-node (one with 90% 1s and 10% 0s).  A second observation is that the p-values shown in the demo output are extremely small (i.e. strong) values &#8211; around 1e-9 (one part in a billion) &#8211; for good-quality splits.  We can also see &#8220;weak&#8221; p-values with magnitudes such as 0.7, 0.2, etc.  These are poor quality splits on the noise features that it rejects and does not use in the tree, exactly as we hope to see.</p>

<p>Next, I will show a similar run with the standard available &#8220;entropy&#8221; quality measure, and a minimum gain threshold of 0.035, which is a value I had to determine by trial and error, as what kind of entropy gains one can expect to see, and where to cut them off, is somewhat unintuitive and likely to be very data dependent.</p>

<p>The first observation is that <strong>the resulting tree using entropy as a split quality measure is twice the size of the tree trained using the chi-squared policy.</strong>  Worse, it is using the noise features &#8211; its quality measure is yielding many more false positives.  The entropy-based model is less parsimonious and will also have performance problems since the model has included very noisy features.</p>

<p>Lastly, I ran a similar training using the &#8220;gini&#8221; impurity measure, and a 0.015 quality threshold (again, hopefully optimal value that I had to run multiple experiments to identify).  Its quality is better than the entropy-based measure, but this model is still substantially larger than the chi-squared model, and it still uses some noise features:</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>In this post I have discussed some advantages of using test statstics and p-values as split quality metrics for decision tree training:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Awareness of sample size</li>
<li>Higher quality model training</li>
</ul>


<p>I believe they are a useful tool for improved training of decision tree models!  Happy computing!</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/05/05/random-forest-clustering-of-machine-package-configurations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I am going to describe some results I obtained for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clustering</a> machines by which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager">RPM packages</a> that were installed on them.  The clustering technique I used was <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#unsup">Random Forest Clustering</a>.</p>

<p><a name="data"></a></p>

<h5>The Data</h5>

<p>The data I clustered consisted of 135 machines, each with a list of installed RPM packages.  The number of unique package names among all 135 machines was 4397.  Each machine was assigned a vector of Boolean values: a value of <code>1</code> indicates that the corresponding RPM was installed on that machine.  This means that the clustering data occupied a space of nearly 4400 dimensions.  I discuss the implications of this <a href="#payoff">later in the post</a>, and what it has to do with Random Forest Clustering in particular.</p>

<p>For ease of navigation and digestion, the remainder of this post is organized in sections:</p>

<h5>Random Forests and Random Forest Clustering</h5>

<p>Full explainations of <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm">Random Forests</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#unsup">Random Forest Clustering</a> could easily occupy blog posts of their own, but I will attempt to summarize them briefly here.  Random Forest learning models <em>per se</em> are well covered in the machine learning community, and available in most machine learning toolkits.  With that in mind, I will focus on their application to Random Forest Clustering, as it is less commonly used.</p>

<p>A Random Forest is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble learning model</a>, consisting of some number of individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision trees</a>, each trained on a random subset of the training data, and which choose from a random subset of candidate features when learning each internal decision node.</p>

<p>Random Forest Clustering begins by training a Random Forest to distinguish between the data to be clustered, and a corresponding <em>synthetic</em> data set created by sampling from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution">marginal</a> distributions of each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector">feature</a>.  If the data has well defined clusters in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution">joint feature space</a> (a common scenario), then the model can identify these clusters as standing out from the more homogeneous distribution of synthetic data.  A simple example of what this looks like in 2 dimensional data is displayed in Figure 1, where the dark red dots are the data to be clustered, and the lighter pink dots represent synthetic data generated from the marginal distributions:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rfc_machines/demo1_both.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Each interior decision node, in each tree of a Random Forest, typically divides the space of feature vectors in half: the half-space &lt;= some threshold, and the half-space > that threshold.  The result is that the model learned for our data can be visualized as rectilinear regions of space.  In this simple example, these regions can be plotted directly over the data, and show that the Random Forest did indeed learn the location of the data clusters against the background of synthetic data:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rfc_machines/demo1_rules.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Once this model has been trained, the actual data to be clustered are evaluated against this model.  Each data element navigates the interior decision nodes and eventually arrives at a leaf-node of each tree in the Random Forest ensemble, as illustrated in the following schematic:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rfc_machines/eval_leafs.png" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>A key insight of Random Forest Clustering is that if two objects (or, their feature vectors) are similar, then they are likely to arrive at the same leaf nodes more often than not.  As the figure above suggests, it means we can cluster objects by their corresponding vectors of leaf nodes, <em>instead</em> of their raw feature vectors.</p>

<p>If we map the points in our toy example to leaf ids in this way, and then cluster the results, we obtain the following two clusters, which correspond well with the structure of the data:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rfc_machines/demo1_clust.png" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>A note on clustering leaf ids.  A leaf id is just that &#8211; an identifier &#8211; and in that respect a vector of leaf ids has no <em>algebra</em>; it is not meaningful to take an average of such identifiers, any more than it would be meaningful to take the average of people&#8217;s names.  Pragmatically, what this means is that the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering algorithm</a> <em>cannot</em> be applied to this problem.</p>

<p>These vectors do, however, have <em>distance</em>: for any pair of vectors, add 1 for each corresponding pair of leaf ids that differ.  If two data elements arrived at all the same leafs in the Random Forest model, all their leaf ids are the same, and their distance is zero (with respect to the model, they are the same).  Therefore, we <em>can</em> apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">k-medoids clustering</a>.</p>

<p><a name="payoff"></a></p>

<h5>The Pay-Off</h5>

<p>What does this somewhat indirect method of clustering buy us?  Why <em>not</em> just cluster objects by their raw feature vectors?</p>

<p>The problem is that in many real-world cases (unlike in our toy example above), feature vectors computed for objects have <em>many dimensions</em> &#8211; hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions &#8211; instead of the two dimensions in this example.  Computing distances on such objects, necessary for clustering, is often expensive, and worse yet the quality of these distances is frequently poor due to the fact that most features in large spaces will be poorly correlated with <em>any</em> structure in the data.  This problem is so common, and so important, it has a name: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">Curse of Dimensionality</a>.</p>

<p>Random Forest Clustering, which clusters on vectors of leaf-node ids from the trees in the model, side-steps the curse of dimensionality because the Random Forest training process, by learning where the data is against the background of the synthetic data, has already identified the features that are useful for identifying the structure of the data!   If any particular feature was poorly correlated with that struture, it has already been ignored by the model.  In other words, a Random Forest Clustering model is implicitly examining <strong> <em>exactly those features that are most useful for clustering</em> </strong>, thus providing a cure for the Curse of Dimensionality.</p>

<p>The <a href="#data">machine package configurations</a> whose clustering I describe for this post are a good example of high dimensional data that is vulnerable to the Curse of Dimensionality.  The dimensionality of the feature space is nearly 4400, making distances between vectors potentially expensive to evaluate.  Any individual feature contributes little to the distance, having to contend with over 4000 other features.  Installed packages are also noisy.  Many packages, such as kernels, are installed everywhere.  Others may be installed but not used, making them potentially irrelevant to grouping machines.  Furthermore, there are only 135 machines, and so there are far more features than data examples, making this an underdetermined data set.</p>

<p>All of these factors make the machine package configuration data a good test of the strenghts of Random Forest Clustering.</p>

<p><a name="code"></a></p>

<h5>Package Configuration Clustering Code</h5>

<p>The implementation of Random Forest Clustering I used for the results in this post is a library available from the <a href="http://silex.freevariable.com/">silex project</a>, a package of analytics libraries and utilities for <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>.</p>

<p>In this section I will describe three code fragments that load the machine configuration data, perform a Random Forest clustering, and format some of the output.  This is the code I ran to obtain the <a href="#results">results</a> described in the final section of this post.</p>

<p>The first fragment of code illustrates the logistics of loading the feature vectors from file <code>train.txt</code> that represent the installed-package configurations for each machine. A corresponding &#8220;parallel&#8221; file <code>nodesclean.txt</code> contains corresponding machine names for each vector.  A third companion file <code>rpms.txt</code> contains names of each installed package.  These are used to instantiate a specialized Scala function (<code>InvertibleIndexFunction</code>) between feature indexes and human-readable feature names (in this case, names of RPM packages).  Finally, another specialized function (<code>Extractor</code>) for instantiating Spark feature vectors is created.</p>

<p>Note: <code>Extractor</code> and <code>InvertibleIndexFunction</code> are also component libraries of <a href="http://silex.freevariable.com/">silex</a></p>

<p>The next section of code is where the work of Random Forest Clustering happens.  A <code>RandomForestCluster</code> object is instantiated, and configured.  Here, the configuration is for 7 clusters, 250 synthetic points (about twice as many synthetic points as true data), and a Random Forest of 20 trees.  Training against the input data is a simple call to the <code>run</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>predictWithDistanceBy</code> method is then applied to the data paired with machine names, to yield tuples of cluster-id, distance to cluster center, and the associated machine name.  These tuples are split by distance into data with a cluster, and data considered to be &#8220;outliers&#8221; (i.e. elements far from any cluster center).  Lastly, the <code>histFeatures</code> method is applied, to examine the Random Forest Model and identify any commonly-used features.</p>

<h5>Package Configuration Clustering Results</h5>

<p>The result of running the code in the <a href="#code">previous section</a> is seven clusters of machines.  In the following files, the first column represents distance from the cluster center, and the second is the actual machine&#8217;s node name.  A cluster distance of 0.0 indicates that the machine was indistinguishable from cluster center, as far as the Random Forest model was concerned.   The larger the distance, the more different from the cluster&#8217;s center a machine was, in terms of its installed RPM packages.</p>

<p>Was the clustering meaningful?  Examining the first two clusters below is promising; the machine names in these clusters are clearly similar, likely configured for some common task by the IT department.  The first cluster of machines appears to be web servers and corresponding backend services.  It would be unsurprising to find their RPM configurations were similar.</p>

<p>The second cluster is a series of executor machines of varying sizes, but presumably these would be configured similarly to one another.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_1"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_2"></script>


<p>The second pair of clusters (3 &amp; 4) are small.  All of their names are similar (and furthermore, similar to some machines in other clusters), and so an IT administrator might wonder why they ended up in oddball small clusters.  Perhaps they have some spurious, non-standard packages installed that ought to be cleaned up.  Identifying these kinds of structure in a clustering is one common clustering application.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_3"></script>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_4"></script>


<p>Cluster 5 is a series of bugzilla web servers and corresponding back-end bugzilla data base services.  Although they were clustered together, we see that the web servers have a larger distance from the center, indicating a somewhat different configuration.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_5"></script>


<p>Cluster 6 represents a group of performance-related machines.  Not all of these machines occupy the same distance, even though most of their names are similar.  These are also the same series of machines as in clusters 3 &amp; 4.  Does this indicate spurious package installations, or some other legitimate configuration difference?  A question for the IT department&#8230;</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_6"></script>


<p>Cluster 7 is by far the largest.  It is primarily a combination of OpenStack machines and yet more perf machines.   This clustering was relatively stable &#8211; it appeared across multiple independent clustering runs.  Because of its stability I would suggest to an IT administrator that the performance and OpenStack machines are sharing some configuration similarities, and the performance machines in other clusters suggest that there might be yet more configuration anomalies.  Perhaps these were OpenStack nodes that were re-purposed as performance machines?  Yet another question for IT&#8230;</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=cluster_7"></script>


<p><a name="outliers"></a></p>

<h5>Outliers</h5>

<p>This last grouping represents machines which were &#8220;far&#8221; from any of the previous cluster centers.  They may be interpreted as &#8220;outliers&#8221; - machines that don&#8217;t fit any model category.  Of these the node <code>frodo</code> is clearly somebody&#8217;s personal machine, likely with a customized or idiosyncratic package configuration.  Unsurprising that it is farthest of all machines from any cluster, with distance 9.0.   The <code>jenkins</code> machine is also somewhat unique among the nodes, and so perhaps not surprising that its registers as anomalous.  The remaining machines match node series from other clusters.   Their large distance is another indication of spurious configurations for IT to examine.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/184d202560c628c0383c5050d9f4be24.js?file=outliers"></script>


<p>I will conclude with another useful feature of Random Forest Models, which is that you can interrogate them for information such as which features were used most frequently.  Here is a histogram of model features (in this case, installed packages) that were used most frequently in the clustering model.  This particular histogram i sinteresting, as no feature was used more than twice.  The remaining features were all used exactly once.  This is a bit unusual for a Random Forest model.  Frequently some features are used commonly, with a longer tail.  This histogram is rather &#8220;flat,&#8221; which may be a consequence of there being many more features (over 4000 installed packages) than there are data elements (135 machines).  This makes the problem somewhat under-determined.  To its credit, the model still achieves a meaningful clustering.</p>

<p>Lastly I&#8217;ll note that full histogram length was 186; in other words, of the nearly 4400 installed packages, the Random Forest model used only 186 of them &#8211; a tiny fraction!  A nice illustration of Random Forest Clustering performing in the face of <a href="#payoff">high dimensionality</a>!</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/03/26/computing-simplex-vertex-locations-from-pairwise-vertex-distances</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suppose I have a collection of (N) objects, and distances d(j,k) between each pair of objects (j) and (k); that is, my objects are members of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space">metric space</a>.  I have no knowledge about my objects, beyond these pair-wise distances.  These objects could be construed as vertices in an (N-1) dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">simplex</a>.  However, since I have no spatial information about my objects, I first need a way to assign spatial locations to each object, in vector space R<sup>(N-1),</sup> with only my object distances to work with.</p>

<p>In this post I will derive an algorithm for assigning vertex locations in R<sup>(N-1)</sup> for each of N objects, using only pairwise object distances.</p>

<p>I will assume that N >= 2, since at least two object are required to define a pairwise distance.  The case N=2 is easy, as I can assign vertex 1 to the origin, and vertex 2 to the point d(1,2), to form a 1-simplex (i.e. a line segment) whose single edge is just the distance between the two objects.  I will also assume that my N objects are distinct; that is, each pair has a non-zero distance.</p>

<p>Next consider an arbitrary N, and suppose I have already added vertices 1 through k.  The next vertex (k+1) must obey the pairwise distance relations, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/jm56vxq.png" alt="figure 1" /></p>

<p>Adding the new vertex (k+1) involves adding another dimension (k) to the simplex.  I define this new kth coordinate x(k) to be zero for the existing k vertices, as annotated above; only the new vertex (k+1) will have a non-zero kth coordinate.  Expanding the quadratic terms on the left yields the following form:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/jtm7dpq.png" alt="figure 2" /></p>

<p>The squared terms for the coordinates of the new vertex (k+1) are inconvenient, however I can get rid of them by subtracting pairs of equations above.  For example, if I subtract equation 1 from the remaining k-1 equations (2 through k), these squared terms disappear, leaving me with the following system of k-1 equations, which we can see is linear in the 1st k-1 coordinates of the new vertex.  Therefore, I know I&#8217;ll be able to solve for those coordinates.  I can solve for the remaining kth coordinate by plugging it into the first distance equation:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/haovm32.png" alt="figure 3" /></p>

<p>To clarify matters, the equations above can be re-written as the following matrix equation, solveable by any linear systems library:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/h6qdtms.png" alt="figure 4" /></p>

<p>This gives me a recusion relation for adding a new vertex (k+1), given that I have already added the first k vertices.  The basis case of adding the first two vertices was already described above.  And so I can iteratively add all my vertices one at a time by applying the recursion relation.</p>

<p>As a corollary, assume that I have constructed a simplex having k vertices, as shown above, and I would like to assign a spatial location to a new object, (y), given its k distances to each vertex.  The corresponding distance relations are given by:</p>

<p><img src="http://mathurl.com/zdw9uv8.png" alt="figure 5" /></p>

<p>I can apply a derivation very similar to the one above, to obtain the following linear equation for the (k-1) coordinates of (y):</p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/02/08/efficient-multiplexing-for-spark-rdds/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-08T10:09:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2016/02/08/efficient-multiplexing-for-spark-rdds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I&#8217;m going to propose a new abstract operation on <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds">Spark RDDs</a> &#8211; <strong>multiplexing</strong> &#8211; that makes some categories of operations on RDDs both easier to program and in many cases much faster.</p>

<p>My main working example will be the operation of splitting a collection of data elements into N randomly-selected subsamples.  This operation is quite common in machine learning, for the purpose of dividing data into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set">training and testing set</a>, or the related task of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics">creating folds for cross-validation</a>).</p>

<p>Consider the current standard RDD method for accomplishing this task, <code>randomSplit()</code>.  This method takes a collection of N weights, and returns N output RDDs, each of which contains a randomly-sampled subset of the input, proportional to the corresponding weight.  The <code>randomSplit()</code> method generates the jth output by running a random number generator (RNG) for each input data element and accepting all elements which are in the corresponding jth (normalized) weight range.  As a diagram, the process looks like this at each RDD partition:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/mux/randomsplit.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>The observation I want to draw attention to is that to produce the N output RDDs, it has to run a random sampling over every element in the input <em>for each output</em>.  So if you are splitting into 10 outputs (e.g. for a 10-fold cross-validation), you are re-sampling your input 10 times, the only difference being that each output is created using a different acceptance range for the RNG output.</p>

<p>To see what this looks like in code, consider a simplified version of random splitting that just takes an integer <code>n</code> and always produces (n) equally-weighted outputs:</p>

<p>(Note that for this method to operate correctly, the RNG seed must be set to the same value each time, or the data will not be correctly partitioned)</p>

<p>While this approach to random splitting works fine, resampling the same data N times is somewhat wasteful.  However, it is possible to re-organize the computation so that the input data is sampled only once.  The idea is to run the RNG once per data element, and save the element into a randomly-chosen collection.  To make this work in the RDD compute model, all N output collections reside in a single row of an <em>intermediate</em> RDD &#8211; a &#8220;manifold&#8221; RDD.  Each output RDD then takes its data from the corresponding collection in the manifold RDD, as in this diagram:</p>

<p>If you abstract the diagram above into a generalized operation, you end up with methods that might like the following:</p>

<p>Here, the operation of sampling is generalized to any user-supplied function that maps RDD partition data into a sequence of objects that are computed in a single pass, and then multiplexed to the final user-visible outputs.  Note that these functions take a <code>StorageLevel</code> argument that can be used to control the caching level of the internal &#8220;manifold&#8221; RDD.  This typically defaults to <code>MEMORY_ONLY</code>, so that the computation can be saved and re-used for efficiency.</p>

<p>An efficient split-sampling method based on multiplexing, as described above, might be written using <code>flatMuxPartitions</code> as follows:</p>

<p>To test whether multiplexed RDDs actually improve compute efficiency, I collected run-time data at various split values of <code>n</code> (from 1 to 10), for both the non-multiplexing logic (equivalent to the standard <code>randomSplit</code>) and the multiplexed version:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/mux/benchmark.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>As the timing data above show, the computation required to run a non-multiplexed version grows linearly with <code>n</code>, just as predicted.  The multiplexed version, by computing the (n) outputs in a single pass, takes a nearly constant amount of time regardless of how many samples the input is split into.</p>

<p>There are other potential applications for multiplexed RDDs.  Consider the following tuple-based versions of multiplexing:</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to run an input-validation filter on some data, sending the data that pass validation into one RDD, and data that failed into a second RDD, paired with information about the error that occurred.  Data validation is a potentially expensive operation.  With multiplexing, you can easily write the filter to operate in a single efficient pass to obtain both the valid stream and the stream of error-data:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to make an argument that the Algebird <a href="http://twitter.github.io/algebird/#com.twitter.algebird.Aggregator">Aggregator</a> design, in particular its use of the <code>prepare</code> operation in a map-reduce context, has substantial inefficiencies, compared to an equivalent formulation that is more directly suited to taking advantage of Scala&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Seq">aggregate method on collections</a> method.</p>

<p>Consider the definition of aggregation in the Aggregator class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scala'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">apply</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">inputs</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">TraversableOnce</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">])</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">C</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">present</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">reduce</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">inputs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">prepare</span><span class="o">)))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can see that it is a standard map/reduce operation, where <code>reduce</code> is defined as a monoidal (or semigroup &#8211; more on this later) operation. Under the hood, it boils down to an invocation of Scala&#8217;s <code>reduceLeft</code> method.  The key thing to notice is that the role of <code>prepare</code> is to map a collection of data elements into the required monoids, which are then aggregated using that monoid&#8217;s <code>plus</code> operation.  In other words, <code>prepare</code> converts data elements into &#8220;singleton&#8221; monoids each representing a data element.</p>

<p>Now, if the monoid in question is simple, say some numeric type, this conversion is free, or nearly so.  For example, the conversion of an integer into the &#8220;integer monoid&#8221; is a no-op.  However, there are other kinds of &#8220;non-trivial&#8221; monoids, for which the conversion of a data element into its corresponding monoid may be costly.  In this post, I will be using the monoid defined by Scala Set[Int], where the monoid <code>plus</code> operation is set union, and of course the <code>zero</code> element is the empty set.</p>

<p>Consider the process of defining an Algebird aggregator for the task of generating the set of unique elements in a data set.  The corresponding <code>prepare</code> operation is: <code>prepare(e: Int) = Set(e)</code>.  A monoid trait that encodes this idea might look like the following.  (the code I used in this post can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/d96dc553bc51e0eb5e4b">here</a>)</p>

<p>If we unpack the above code, as applied to <code>intSetPrepared</code>, we are instantiating a new Set object, containing a single value, for every single input data element.</p>

<p>But there is a potentially better model of aggregation, exemplified by the Scala <code>aggregate</code> method.  This method does not use a <code>prepare</code> operation.  It uses a zero value and a monoidal operator, which the Scala docs refer to as <code>combop</code>, but it also uses an &#8220;update&#8221; operation, that defines how to update the monoid object, directly, with a single element, referred to as <code>seqop</code> in Scala&#8217;s documentation.  This idea can also be encoded as a flavor of monoid, enhanced with an <code>update</code> method:</p>

<p>This arrangement promises more efficiency when aggregating w.r.t. nontrivial monoids, by avoiding the construction of &#8220;singleton&#8221; monoids for each data element.  The following demo confirms that for the Set-based monoid, it is over 10 times faster:</p>

<p>Readers familiar with Algebird may be wondering about my use of monoids above, when the <code>Aggregator</code> interface is actually based on semigroups.  This is important, since building on Scala&#8217;s <code>aggregate</code> function requires a zero element that semigroups do not have.  Although I believe it might be worth considering changing <code>Aggregator</code> to use monoids, another sensible option is to change the internal logic for the subclass <code>AggregatorMonoid</code>, which does require a monoid, or possibly just define a new <code>AggregatorMonoidUpdated</code> subclass.</p>

<p>A final note on compatability: note that any monoid enhanced with <code>prepare</code> can be converted into an equivalent monoid enhanced with <code>update</code>, as demonstrated by this factory function:</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/11/20/very-fast-reservoir-sampling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will demonstrate how to do reservoir sampling orders of magnitude faster than the traditional &#8220;naive&#8221; reservoir sampling algorithm, using a fast high-fidelity approximation to the reservoir sampling-gap distribution.</p>

<blockquote><p>The code I used to collect the data for this post can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/reservoir/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/sample/reservoir/reservoir.scala">here</a>.  I generated the plots using the <a href="https://github.com/quantifind/wisp">quantifind WISP</a> project.</p>

<p>Update (April 4, 2016): my colleague <a href="http://rnowling.github.io/">RJ Nowling</a> ran across a <a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit87.RandomSampling.pdf">paper by J.S. Vitter</a> that shows Vitter developed the trick of accelerating sampling with a sampling-gap distribution in 1987 &#8211; I re-invented Vitter&#8217;s wheel 30 years after the fact!  I&#8217;m surprised it never caught on, as it is not much harder to implement than the naive version.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> for the corresponding sampling distributions.  More recently, I also began exploring whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">reservoir sampling</a> might also be optimized using the gap sampling technique, by deriving the <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">reservoir sampling gap distribution</a>.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it presupposes that you can actually draw values from that distribution substantially faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.  I was unable to come up with a &#8220;direct&#8221; algorithm for drawing samples from P(k) above (I suspect none exists), however I also know the CDF F(k), so it <em>is</em> possible to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inversion sampling</a>, which runs in logarithmic time w.r.t the desired accuracy.  Although its logarithmic cost effectively guarantees that it will be a net efficiency win for sufficiently large (j), it still involves a substantial number of computations to yield its samples, and it seems unlikely to be competitive with straight &#8220;naive&#8221; reservoir sampling over many real-world data sizes, where (j) may never grow very large.</p>

<p>Well, if exact computations are too expensive, we can always look for a fast approximation.  Consider the original &#8220;first principles&#8221; formula for the sampling gap P(k):</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>As the figure above alludes to, if (j) is relatively large compared to (k), then values (j+1),(j+2)&#8230;(j+k) are all going to be effectively &#8220;close&#8221; to (j), and so we can replace them all with (j) as an approximation.  Note that the resulting approximation is just the PMF of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric distribution</a>, with probability of success p=(R/j), and we already saw how to efficiently draw values from a geometric distribution from our experience with Bernoulli sampling.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to hope that this approximation will be useful?  For reasons that are similar to those for Bernoulli gap sampling, it will only be efficient to employ gap sampling when the probability (R/j) becomes small enough.  From our experiences with Bernoulli sampling that is <em>at least</em> j>=2R.  So, we have some assurance that (j) itself will be never be <em>very</em> small.  What about (k)?  Note that a geometric distribution &#8220;favors&#8221; smaller values of (k) &#8211; that is, small values of (k) have the highest probabilities.  In fact, the smaller that (j) is, the larger the probability (R/j) is, and so the more likely that (k) values that are small relative to (j) will be the frequent ones.  It is also promising that the true distribution for P(k) <em>also</em> favors smaller values of (k) (in fact it favors them even a bit more strongly than the approximation).</p>

<p>Although it is encouraging, it is also clear that my argument above is limited to heuristic hand-waving.  What does this approximation really <em>look</em> like, compared to the true distribution?  Fortunately, it is easy to plot both distributions numerically, since we now know the formulas for both:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/CDFs_R=10.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>The plot above shows that, in fact, the geometric approximation is a <em>surprisingly good</em> approximation to the true distribution!  Furthermore, the approximation remains good as both (j) and (k) grow larger.</p>

<p>Our numeric eye-balling looks quite promising.  Is there an effective way to <em>measure</em> how good this approximation is?  One useful measure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic</a>, which is just the maximum absolute error between two cumulative distributions.  Here is a plot of the D statistic for reservoir size R=10, as (j) varies across several magnitudes:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/R=10.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This plot is also good news: we can see that deviation, as measured by D, remains bounded at a small value (less than 0.0262).  As this is for the specific value R=10, we also want to know how things change as reservoir size changes:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/R=all.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p>The news is still good!  As reservoir size grows, the approximation only gets better: the D values get smaller as R increases, and remain asymptotically bounded as (j) increases.</p>

<p>Now we have some numeric assurance that the geometric approximation is a good one, and stays good as reservoir size grows and sampling runs get longer.  However, we should also verify that an actual implementation of the approximation works as expected.</p>

<p>Here is pseudocode for an implementation of reservoir sampling using the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<pre><code>// data is array to sample from
// R is the reservoir size
function reservoirFast(data: Array, R: Int) {
  n = data.length
  // Initialize reservoir with first R elements of data:
  res = data[0 until R]
  // Until this threshold, use traditional sampling.  This value may
  // depend on performance characteristics of random number generation and/or
  // numeric libraries:
  t = 4 * R
  j = 1 + R
  while (j &lt; n  &amp;&amp;  j &lt;= t) {
    k = randomInt(j) // random integer &gt;= 0 and &lt; j
    if (k &lt; R) res[k] = data[j]
    j = j + 1
  }
  // Once gaps become significant, it pays to do gap sampling
  while (j &lt; n) {
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = R/j
    p = R / j
    u = randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1
    g = floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    j = j + g
    if (j &lt; n) {
      k = randomInt(R)
      res[k] = data[j]
    }
    j = j + 1
  }
  // return the reservoir
  return res
}
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a plot that shows two-sample D statistics, comparing the distribution in sample gaps between runs of the exact &#8220;naive&#8221; reservoir sampling with the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/D_naive_vs_fast.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>As expected, the measured difference in sampling characteristics between naive and fast approximation are small, confirming the numeric predictions.</p>

<p>Since the point of this exercise was to achieve faster random sampling, it remains to measure what kind of speed improvements the fast approximation provides.  As a point of reference, here is a plot of run times for reservoir sampling over 10<sup>8</sup> integers:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/naive_sample_time_vs_R.png" title="Figure 7" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<p>As expected, sample time remains constant at around 1.5 seconds, regardless of reservoir size, since the naive algorithm always samples from its RNG per each sample.</p>

<p>Compare this to the corresponding plot for the fast geometric approximation:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sample_times_vs_R.png" title="Figure 8" alt="Figure 8" /></p>

<p>Firstly, we see that the sampling times are <em>much faster</em>, as originally anticipated in my <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution/">previous post</a> &#8211; in the neighborhood of 3 orders of magnitude faster.  Secondly, we see that the sampling times do increase as a linear function of reservoir size.  Based on our experience with Bernoulli gap sampling, this is expected; the sampling probabilities are given by (R/j), and therefore the amount of sampling is proportional to R.</p>

<p>Another property anticipated in my previous post was that the efficiency of gap sampling should continue to increase as the amount of data sampled grows; the sampling probability being (R/j), the probability of sampling decreases as j gets larger, and so the corresponding gap sizes grow.  The following plot verifies this property, holding reservoir size R constant, and increasing the data size:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir2/gap_sampling_efficiency.png" title="Figure 9" alt="Figure 9" /></p>

<p>The sampling time (per million elements) decreases as the sample size grows, as predicted by the formula.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have demonstrated that a geometric distribution can be used as a high quality approximation to the true sampling gap distribution for reservoir sampling, which allows reservoir sampling to be performed much faster than the naive algorithm while still retaining sampling quality.</p>

<h5>A Motivating Use Case</h5>

<p>The skeptical programmer may be wondering what the point of Yet Another Map Collection really is, much less an entire class hierarchy.  The use case that inspired this work was <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird/pull/495">my project</a> of implementing the <a href="https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf">t-digest algorithm</a>.  Discussion of t-digest is beyond the scope of this post, but suffice it to say that constructing a t-digest requires the maintenance of a collection of &#8220;cluster&#8221; objects, that needs to satisfy the following several properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>an entry contains one <strong>or more</strong> cluster objects at a given numeric location</li>
<li>entries are maintained in a numeric key order</li>
<li>entries will be frequently inserted and deleted, in arbitrary order</li>
<li>given a numeric key value, be able to find the entry nearest to that value</li>
<li>given a key, compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum">prefix-sum</a> for that value</li>
<li>all of the above should be bounded by logarithmic time complexity</li>
</ol>


<p>Propreties 2,3 and 6 are commonly satisfied by a map structure backed by some variety of balanced tree representation, of which the best-known is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-Black tree</a>.</p>

<p>Properties 1, 4 and 5 are more interesting.  Property 1 &#8211; representing a collection of multiple objects at each entry &#8211; can be accomplished in a generalizable way by noting that a collection is representable as a monoid, and so supporting values that can be incremented with respect to a <a href="http://twitter.github.io/algebird/index.html#com.twitter.algebird.Monoid">user-supplied monoid relation</a> can satisfy property-1, but also can support many other kinds of update, including but not limited to classical numeric incrementing operations.</p>

<p>Properties 4 and 5 &#8211; nearest-entry queries and prefix-sum queries &#8211; are also both supportable in logarithmic time using a tree data structure, provided that tree is balanced.  Again, the details of the algorithms are out of the current scope, however they are not extremely complex, and their implementations are available in the code.</p>

<p>A reader with their software engineering hat on will notice that these properties are <em>orthogonal</em>.  A programmer might be interested in a data structure supporting any one of them, or in some mixed combination.   This kind of situation fairly shouts &#8220;Scala traits&#8221; (or, alternatively, interfaces in Java, etc).  With that idea in mind, I designed a system of Scala collection traits that support all of the above properties, in a pure trait form that is fully &#8220;mixable&#8221; by the programmer, so that one can use exactly the properties needed, but not pay for anything else.</p>

<p><a name="overview"></a></p>

<h5>Library Overview</h5>

<p>The library consists broadly of 3 kinds of traits:</p>

<ul>
<li>tree node traits &#8211; implement core tree support for some functionality</li>
<li>collection traits &#8211; provide additional collection API methods the user</li>
<li>collections &#8211; instantiate a usable incarnation of a collection</li>
</ul>


<p>For the programmer who wishes to either create a trait mixture, or add new mixable traits, the collections also function as reference implementations.</p>

<p>The three tables that follow summarize the currently available traits of each kind listed above.  They are (at the time of this posting) all under the package namespace <code>com.redhat.et.silex.maps</code>:</p>

<h5>A Red/Black Tree Base Class</h5>

<p>The most fundamental trait in this hierarchy is the trait that embodies Red-Black balancing; a &#8220;red-black-ness&#8221; trait, as it were.  This trait supplies the axiomatic tree operations of insertion, deletion and key lookup, where the Red-Black balancing operations are encapsulated for insertion (due to <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=44273">Chris Okasaki</a>) and deletion (due to <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/smk/redblack/rb.html">Stefan Kahrs</a>)  Note that Red-Black trees do not assume a separate value, as in a map, but require only keys (thus implementing an ordered set over the key type):</p>

<p>I will assume most readers are familiar with basic binary tree operations, and the Red-Black rules are described elsewhere (I adapted them from the Scala red-black implementation).  For the purposes of this discussion, the most interesting feature is that this is a <em>pure Scala trait</em>.  All <code>val</code> declarations are abstract.  This trait, by itself, cannot function without a subclass to eventually perform dependency injection.   However, this abstraction allows the trait to be inherited freely &#8211; any programmer can inherit from this trait and get a basic Red-Black balanced tree for (nearly) free, as long as a few basic principles are adhered to for proper dependency injection.</p>

<p>Another detail to call out is the abstraction of the usual <code>key</code> with a <code>Data</code> element.  This element represents any node payload that is moved around as a unit during tree structure manipulations, such as balancing pivots.  In the case of a map-like subclass, <code>Data</code> is extended to include a <code>value</code> field as well as a <code>key</code> field.</p>

<p>The other noteworthy detail is the abstract definition <code>def iNode(color: Color, d: Data[K], lsub: Node[K], rsub: Node[K]): INode[K]</code> - this is the function called to create any new tree node.  In fact, this function, when eventually instantiated, is what performs dependency injection of other tree node fields.</p>

<h5>Node Inheritance Example: NodeMap[K,V]</h5>

<p>A relatively simple example of node inheritance is hopefully instructive.  Here is the definition for tree nodes supporting a key/value map:</p>

<p>Note that in this case very little is added to the red/black functionality already provided by <code>Node[K]</code>.  A <code>DataMap[K,V]</code> trait is defined to add a <code>value</code> field in addition to the <code>key</code>, and the internal node <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> refines the type of its <code>data</code> field to be <code>DataMap[K,V]</code>.  The semantics is little more than &#8220;tree nodes now carry a value in addition to a key.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tree node trait inherits from its own parent class <em>and</em> the corresponding traits for any mixed-in functionality.  So for example <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> inherits from <code>NodeMap[K,V]</code> but also <code>INode[K]</code>.</p>

<p>You can see that this trait supplies collection API methods that a Scala programmer will recognize as being standard for any map-like collection.  Note that this trait also inherits other standard methods from <code>OrderedLike[K,IN,M]</code> (common to both sets and maps) and <em>also</em> inherits from <code>NodeMap[K,V]</code>: In other words, a collection is effectively yet another kind of tree node, with additional collection API methods mixed in.   Note also the use of &#8220;self types&#8221; (the type parameter <code>M</code>), which allows the collection to return objects of its own kind.  This is crucial for allowing operations like data insertion to return an object that also supports node insertion, and to maintain consistency of type across operations.  The collection type is properly &#8220;closed&#8221; with respect to its own operations.</p>

<p>You can see that (aside from a convenience override of <code>toString</code>) the trait <code>OrderedMap[K,V]</code> is nothing more than a vehicle for instantiating a particular concrete <code>OrderedMapLike[K,V,IN,M]</code> subtype, with particular concrete types for internal node (<code>INodeMap[K,V]</code>) and its own self-type.</p>

<p>Things become a little more interesting inside the companion object <code>OrderedMap</code>:</p>

<p>Note that the object returned by the factory method is upcast to <code>OrderedMap[K,V]</code>, but in fact has the more complicated type: <code>InjectMap[K,V] with LNodeMap[K,V] with OrderedMap[K,V]</code>.  There are a couple things going on here.  The trait <code>LNodeMap[K,V]</code> ensures that the new object is in particular a leaf node, which embodies a new empty tree in the Red-Black tree system.</p>

<p>The type <code>InjectMap[K,V]</code> has an even more interesting purpose.  Here is its definition:</p>

<p>Firstly, note that it is a bona fide <em>class</em>, as opposed to a trait.  This class is where, finally, all things abstract are made real &#8211; &#8220;dependency injection&#8221; in the parlance of Scala idioms.  You can see that it defines the implementation of abstract method <code>iNode</code>, and that it does this by returning yet <em>another</em> <code>InjectMap[K,V]</code> object, mixed with both <code>INodeMap[K,V]</code> and <code>OrderedMap[K,V]</code>, thus maintaining closure with respect to all three slices of functionality: dependency injection, the proper type of internal node, and map collection methods.</p>

<p>The various abstract <code>val</code> fields <code>color</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>lsub</code> and <code>rsub</code> are all given concrete values inside of <code>iNode</code>.  Here is where the value of concrete &#8220;reference&#8221; implementations manifests.  Any fields in the relevant internal-node type must be instantiated here, and the logic of instantiation cannot be inherited while still preserving the ability to mix abstract traits.  Therefore, any programmer wishing to create a new concrete sub-class must replicate the logic for instantiating all inherited in an internal node.</p>

<p>Another example makes the implications more clear.  Here is the definition of injection for a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/blog/rbtraits/src/test/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/maps/mixed.scala">collection that mixes in all three traits</a> for incrementable values, nearest-key queries, and prefix-sum queries:</p>

<p>Here you can see that all logic for both &#8220;basic&#8221; internal nodes and also for maintaining prefix sums, and key min/max information for nearest-entry queries, must be supplied.  If there is a singularity in this design here is where it is.  The saving grace is that it is localized into a single well defined place, and any logic can be transcribed from a proper reference implementation of whatever traits are being mixed.</p>

<h5>Finale: Trait Mixing</h5>

<p>I will conclude by showing the code for mixing tree node traits and collection traits, which is elegant.  Here are type definitions for tree nodes and collection traits that inherit from incrementable values, nearest-key queries, and prefix-sum queries, and there is almost no code except the proper inheritances:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I want to discuss several advantages of defining lightweight non-negative numeric types in Scala, whose primary benefit is that they allow improved type signatures for Scala functions and methods.  I&#8217;ll first describe the simple class definition, and then demonstrate how it can be used in function signatures and the benefits of doing so.</p>

<p>If the following ideas interest you at all, I highly recommend looking at the <a href="https://github.com/fthomas/refined">&#8216;refined&#8217; project</a> authored by <a href="http://timepit.eu/~frank/">Frank S. Thomas</a>, which generalizes on the ideas below and supports additional static checking functionalities via macros.</p>

<h5>A Non-Negative Integer Type</h5>

<p>As a working example, I&#8217;ll discuss a non-negative integer type <code>NonNegInt</code>.  My proposed definition is sufficiently lightweight to view as a single code block:</p>

<p>The notable properties and features of <code>NonNegInt</code> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>NonNegInt</code> is a value class around an <code>Int</code>, and so invokes no actual object construction or allocation</li>
<li>Its constructor is private, and so is safe from directly constructing around a negative integer</li>
<li>It supplies factory method <code>NonNegInt(v)</code> to construct a non negative integer value</li>
<li>It supplies implicit conversion from <code>Int</code> values to <code>NonNegInt</code></li>
<li>Both factory method and implicit conversion check for negative values.  There is no way to construct a <code>NonNegInt</code> that contains a negative integer value.</li>
<li>It also supplies implicit conversion from <code>NonNegInt</code> back to <code>Int</code>.  Moving back and forth between <code>Int</code> and <code>NonNegInt</code> is effectively transparent.</li>
</ul>


<p>The above properties work to make <code>NonNegInt</code> very lightweight with respect to size and runtime properties, and semantically safe in the sense that it is impossible to construct one with a negative value inside it.</p>

<h5>Application of <code>NonNegInt</code></h5>

<p>I primarily envision <code>NonNegInt</code> as an easy and informative way to declare function parameters that are only well defined for non-negative values, without the need to write any explicit checking code, and yet allowing the programmer to call the function with normal <code>Int</code> values, due to the implicit conversions:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This short example demonstrates some appealing properties of <code>NonNegInt</code>.  Firstly, the constraint that index <code>j &gt;= 0</code> is enforced via the type definition, and so the programmer does not have to write the usual <code>require(j &gt;= 0, ...)</code> check (or worry about forgetting it).  Secondly, the implicit conversion from <code>Int</code> to <code>NonNegInt</code> means the programmer can just provide a regular integer value for parameter <code>j</code>, instead of having to explicitly say <code>NonNegInt(1)</code>.  Third, the implicit conversion from <code>NonNegInt</code> to <code>Int</code> means that <code>j</code> can easily be used anywhere a regular <code>Int</code> is used.  Last, and very definitely not least, the fact that function <code>element</code> requires a non-negative integer is obvious <strong>right in the function signature</strong>.  There is no need for a programmer to guess whether <code>j</code> can be negative, and no need for the author of <code>element</code> to document that <code>j</code> cannot be negative.  Its type makes that completely clear.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>In this post I&#8217;ve laid out some advantages of defining lightweight non-negative numeric types, in particular using <code>NonNegInt</code> as a working example.  Clearly, if you want to apply this idea, you&#8217;d want to also define <code>NonNegLong</code>, <code>NonNegDouble</code>, <code>NonNegFloat</code> and for that matter <code>PosInt</code>, <code>PosLong</code>, etc.  Happy computing!</p>

    <updated>2015-08-17T07:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/17/the-reservoir-sampling-gap-distribution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling/">previous post</a>, I showed that random Bernoulli and Poisson sampling could be made much faster by modeling the <em>sampling gap distribution</em> - that is, directly drawing random samples from the distribution of how many elements would be skipped over between actual samples taken.</p>

<p>Another popular sampling algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling">Reservoir Sampling</a>.  Its sampling logic is a bit more complicated than Bernoulli or Poisson sampling, in the sense that the probability of sampling any given (jth) element <em>changes</em>. For a sampling reservoir of size R, and all j>R, the probability of choosing element (j) is R/j.  You can see that the potential payoff for gap-sampling is big, particularly as data size becomes large; as (j) approaches infinity, the probability R/j goes to zero, and the corresponding gaps between samples grow without bound.</p>

<p>Modeling a sampling gap distribution is a powerful tool for optimizing a sampling algorithm, but it requires that (1) you actually <em>know</em> the sampling distribution, and (2) that you can effectively draw values from that distribution faster than just applying a random process to drawing each data element.</p>

<p>With that goal in mind, I derived the probability mass function (pmf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the sampling gap distribution of reservoir sampling.  In this post I will show the derivations.</p>

<h3>The Sampling Gap Distribution</h3>

<p>In the interest of making it easy to get at the actual answers, here are the pmf and cdf for the Reservoir Sampling Gap Distribution.  For a sampling reservoir of size (R), starting at data element (j), the probability distribution of the sampling gap is:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>In the derivations that follow, I will keep to some conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>R = the sampling reservoir size.  R > 0.</li>
<li>j = the index of a data element being considered for sampling.  j > R.</li>
<li>k = the size of a gap between samples.  k >= 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>P(k) is the probability that the gap between one sample and the next is of size k.  The support for P(k) is over all k>=0.  I will generally assume that j>R, as the first R samples are always loaded into the reservoir and the actual random sampling logic starts at j=R+1.  The constraint j>R will also be relevant to many binomial coefficient expressions, where it ensures the coefficient is well defined.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Probability Mass Function, P(k)</h3>

<p>Suppose we just chose (randomly) to sample data element (j-1).  Now we are interested in the probability distribution of the next sampling gap.  That is, the probability P(k) that we will <em>not</em> sample the next (k) elements {j,j+1,&#8230;j+k-1}, and sample element (j+k):</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure1.png" title="Figure 1" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>By arranging the product terms in descending order as above, you can see that they can be written as factorial quotients:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure2.png" title="Figure 2" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>Now we apply <a href="#LemmaA">Lemma A</a>.  The 2nd case (a&lt;=b) of the Lemma applies, since (j-1-R)&lt;=j, so we have:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure3.png" title="Figure 3" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>And so we have now derived a compact, closed-form expression for P(k).</p>

<h3>Deriving the Cumulative Distribution Function, F(k)</h3>

<p>Now that we have a derivation for the pmf P(k), we can tackle a derivation for the cdf.  First I will make note of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Series_involving_binomial_coefficients">useful identity</a> that I scraped off of Wikipedia (I substituted (x) => (a) and (k) => (b)):</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/identity1.png" title="identity 1" alt="identity 1" /></p>

<p>The cumulative distribution function for the sampling gap, F(k), is of course just the sum over P(t), for (t) from 0 up to (k):</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure4.png" title="Figure 4" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>This is a closed-form solution, but we can apply a bit more simplification:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure5.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>We have derived closed-form expressions for the pmf and cdf of the Reservoir Sampling gap distribution:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/reservoir1/figure6.png" title="Figure 6" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<p>In order to apply these results to a practical gap-sampling implementation of Reservoir Sampling, we would next need a way to efficiently sample from P(k), to obtain gap sizes to skip over.  How to accomplish this is an open question, but knowing a formula for P(k) and F(k) is a start.</p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/14/generalizing-kendalls-tau/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-14T14:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/08/14/generalizing-kendalls-tau</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have been applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient">Kendall&#8217;s Tau</a> as an evaluation metric to assess how well a regression model ranks input samples, with respect to a known correct ranking.</p>

<p>The process of implementing the Kendall&#8217;s Tau statistic, with my software engineer&#8217;s hat on, caused me to reflect a bit on how it could be generalized beyond the traditional application of ranking numeric pairs.  In this post I&#8217;ll discuss the generalization of Kendall&#8217;s Tau to non-numeric data, and also generalizing from totally ordered data to partial orderings.</p>

<h5>A Review of Kendall&#8217;s Tau</h5>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with a brief review of Kendall&#8217;s Tau.  For more depth, a good place to start is the Wikipedia article at the link above.</p>

<p>Consider a sequence of (n) observations where each observation is a pair (x,y), where we wish to measure how well a ranking by x-values agrees with a ranking by the y-values.  Informally, Kendall&#8217;s Tau (aka the Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient) is the difference between number of observation-pairs (pairs of pairs, if you will) whose ordering <em>agrees</em> (&#8220;concordant&#8221; pairs) and the number of such pairs whose ordering <em>disagrees</em> (&#8220;discordant&#8221; pairs).  This difference is divided by the total number of observation pairs.</p>

<p>The commonly-used formulation of Kendall&#8217;s Tau is the &#8220;Tau-B&#8221; statistic, which accounts for observed pairs having tied values in either x or y as being neither concordant nor discordant:</p>

<h6>Figure 1: Kendall&#8217;s Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_1.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The formulation above has quadratic complexity, with respect to data size (n).  It is possible to rearrange this computation in a way that can be computed in (n)log(n) time[1]:</p>

<h6>Figure 2: An (n)log(n) formulation of Kendall&#8217;s Tau-B</h6>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/kendalls_tau/figure_2.png" title="Kendall's Tau" alt="Kendall's Tau" /></p>

<p>The details of performing this computation can be found at [1] or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient#Algorithms">Wikipedia entry</a>.  For my purposes, I&#8217;ll note that it requires two (n)log(n) sorts of the data, which becomes relevant below.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Non-Numeric Values</h5>

<p>Generalizing Kendall&#8217;s Tau to non-numeric values is mostly just making the observation that the definition of &#8220;concordant&#8221; and &#8220;discordant&#8221; pairs is purely based on comparing x-values and y-values (and, in the (n)log(n) formulation, performing sorts on the data).  From the software engineer&#8217;s perspective this means that the computations are well defined on any data type with an ordering relation, which includes numeric types but also chars, strings, sequences of any element supporting an ordering, etc.  Significantly, most programming languages support the concept of defining ordering relations on arbitrary data types, which means that <em><em>Kendall&#8217;s Tau can, in principle, be computed on literally any kind of data structure</em></em>, provided you supply it with a well defined ordering.  Furthermore, an examination of the algorithms shows that values of x and y need not even be of the same type, nor do they require the same ordering.</p>

<h5>Generalizing to Partial Orderings</h5>

<p>When I brought this observation up, my colleague <a href="http://chapeau.freevariable.com/">Will Benton</a> asked the very interesting question of whether it&#8217;s also possible to compute Kendall&#8217;s Tau on objects that have only a <em>partial ordering</em>.  It turns out that you <em><em>can</em></em> define Kendall&#8217;s Tau on partially ordered data, by defining the case of two non-comparable x-values, or y-values, as another kind of tie.</p>

<p>The big caveat with this definition is that the (n)log(n) optimization does not apply.  Firstly, the optimized algorithm relies heavily on (n)log(n) sorting, and there is no unique full sorting of elements that are only partially ordered.  Secondly, the formula&#8217;s definition of the quantities n1, n2 and n3 is founded on the assumption that element equality is transitive; this is why you can count a number of tied values, t, and use t(t-1)/2 as the corresponding number of tied pairs.  But in a partial ordering, this assumption is violated. Consider the case where (a) &lt; (b), but (a) is non-comparable to (c) and (b) is also non-comparable to (c).  By our definition, (a) is tied with (c), and (c) is tied with (b), but transitivity is violated, as (a) &lt; (b).</p>

<p>So how <em>can</em> we compute Tau in this case?  Consider (n1) and (n2), in Figure-1.  These values represent the number of pairs that were tied wrt (x) and (y), respectively.  We can&#8217;t use the shortcut formulas for (n1) and (n2), but we can count them directly, pair by pair, simply by conducting the traditional quadratic iteration over pairs, and incrementing (n1) whenever two x-values are noncomparable, and incrementing (n2) whenever two y-values are non-comparable, just as we increment (nc) and (nd) to count concordant and discordant pairs.  With this modification, we can apply the formula in Figure-1 as-is.</p>

<h5>Conclusions</h5>

<p>I made these observations without any particular application in mind. However, my instincts as a software engineer tell me that making generalizations in this way often paves the way for new ideas, once the generalized concept is made available.  With luck, it will inspire either me or somebody else to apply Kendall&#8217;s Tau in interesting new ways.</p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/05/06/parallel-k-medoids-using-scala-parseq/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-06T16:33:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/05/06/parallel-k-medoids-using-scala-parseq</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scala supplies a <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">parallel collections library</a> that was designed to make it easy for a programmer to add parallel computing over the elements in a collection.  In this post, I will describe a case study of applying Scala&#8217;s parallel collections to cleanly implement multithreading support for training a K-Medoids clustering model.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids">K-Medoids clustering</a> is a relative of K-Means clustering that does not require an algebra over input data elements.  That is, K-Medoids requires only a distance metric defined on elements in the data space, and can cluster objects which do not have a well-defined concept of addition or division that is necessary for computing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid">centroids</a> required by K-Means.  For example, K-Medoids can cluster character strings, which have a notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">distance</a>, but no notion of summation that could be used to compute a geometric centroid.</p>

<p>This additional generality comes at a cost.  The medoid of a collection of elements is the member of the collection that minimizes some function F of the distances from that element to all the other elements in the collection.  For example, F might be the sum of distances from one element to all the elements, or perhaps the maximum distance, etc.  <strong>It is not hard to see that the cost of computing a medoid of (n) elements is quadratic in (n)</strong>: Evaluating F is linear in (n) and F in turn must be evaluated with respect to each element.  Furthermore, unlike centroid-based computations used in K-Means, computing a medoid does not naturally lend itself to common scale-out computing formalisms such as Spark RDDs, due to the full-cross-product nature of the computation.</p>

<p>With this in mind, a more traditional multithreading approach is a good candidate to achieve some practical parallelism on modern multi-core hardware.  I&#8217;ll demonstrate that this is easy to implement in Scala with parallel sequences.</p>

<h3>Non-Parallel Code</h3>

<p>Consider a baseline non-parallel implementation of K-Medoids, as in the following example skeleton code.  (A working version of this code, under review at the time of this post, can be <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/silex/blob/parseq_blog/src/main/scala/com/redhat/et/silex/cluster/KMedoids.scala">viewed here</a>)</p>

<p>If we run the code above (de-skeletonized), then we might see something like this output from our benchmarking, where I clustered a dataset of 40,000 randomly-generated (x,y,z) points by Gaussian sampling around 5 chosen centers.  (This data is numeric, but I provide only a distance metric on the points.  K-Medoids has no knowledge of the data except that it can run the given metric function on it):</p>

<p>Observe that cluster sizes are generally not the same, and we can see the time per cluster varying quadratically with respect to cluster size.</p>

<h3>A First Take On Parallel K-Medoids</h3>

<p>Studying our non-parallel code above, we can see that the computation of each new medoid is independent, which makes it a likely place to inject some parallelism. A Scala sequence can be transformed into a corresponding parallel sequence using the <code>par</code> method, and so parallelizing our code is literally this simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Parallelizing a collection with .par </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this block, I also apply <code>.seq</code> at the end, which is not always necessary but can avoid type mismatches between <code>Seq[T]</code> and <code>ParSeq[T]</code> under some circumstances.</p>

<p>In my case I also wish to exercise some control over the threading used by the parallelism, and so I explicitly assign a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread pool to the sequence:</p>

<p>Minor grievance: it would be nice if Scala supported some &#8216;in-line&#8217; methods, like <code>seq.par(n)...</code> and <code>seq.par(threadPool)...</code>, instead of requiring the programmer to break the flow of the code to invoke <code>tasksupport =</code>, which returns <code>Unit</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve parallelized our K-Medoids training, we should see how well it responds to additional threads.  I ran the above parallelized version using <code>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}</code> threads, on a machine with 40 cores, so that my benchmarking would not be impacted by attempting to run more threads than there are cores to support them.  I also ran two versions of test data.  The first I generated with clusters of equal size (5 clusters of ~8000 elements), and the second with one cluster being twice as large (1 cluster of ~13300 and 4 clusters of ~6700).  Following is a plot of throughput (iterations / second) versus threads:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/parseq/by_cluster_1.png" title="Throughput As A Function Of Threads" ></p>

<p>In the best of all possible worlds, our throughput would increase linearly with the number of threads; double the threads, double our iterations per second.  Instead, our throughput starts to increase nicely as we add threads, but hits a hard ceiling at 8 threads.  It is not hard to see why: our parallelism is limited by the number of elements in our collection of clusters.  In our case that is k = 5, and so we reach our ceiling at 8 threads, the first thread number >= 5.  Furthermore, we see that when the size of clusters is unequal, the throughput suffers even more.  The time required to complete the clustering is dominated by the most expensive element.  In our case, the cluster that is twice the size of other clusters:</p>

<h3>Take 2: Improving The Use Of Threads</h3>

<p>Fortunately it is not hard to improve on this situation.  If parallelizing by cluster is too coarse, we can try pushing our parallelism down one level of granularity.  In our case, that means parallelizing the outer loop of our medoid function, and it is just as easy as before:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Parallelize the outer loop of medoid computation </span></figcaption>

<p>Note that I retained the previous parallelism at the cluster level, otherwise the algorithm would execute parallel medoids, but one cluster at a time.  Also observe that we are applying the same thread pool we supplied to the ParSeq at the cluster level.  Scala&#8217;s parallel logic can utilize the same thread pool at multiple granularities without blocking.  This makes it very clean to control the total number of threads used by some computation, by simply re-using the same threadpool across all points of parallelism.</p>

<p>Now, when we re-run our experiment, we see that our throughput continues to increase as we add threads.  The following plot illustrates the throughput increasing in comparison to the previous ceiling, and also that throughput is less sensitive to the cluster size, as threads can be allocated flexibly across clusters as they are available:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/parseq/all_1.png" title="Thread utilization improves at finer granularity" ></p>

<p>I hope this short case study has demonstrated how easy it is to add multithreading to computations with Scala parallel sequences, and some considerations for making the best use of available threads.  Happy Parallel Programming!</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/03/31/hygienic-closures-for-scala-function-serialization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In most use cases of Scala closures, what you see is what you get, but there are exceptions where looks can be deceiving and this can have a big impact on closure serialization.  Closure serialization is of more than academic interest.  Tools like Apache Spark cannot operate without serializing functions over the network.  In this post I&#8217;ll describe some scenarios where closures include more than what is evident in the code, and then a technique for preventing unwanted inclusions.</p>

<p>To establish a bit of context, consider this simple example that obtains a function and serializes it to disk, and which <em>does</em> behave as expected:</p>

<pre><code>object Demo extends App {
  def write[A](obj: A, fname: String) {
    import java.io._
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fname)).writeObject(obj)
  }

  object foo {
    val v = 42
    // The returned function includes 'v' in its closure
    def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
  }

  // The function 'f' will serialize as expected
  val f = foo.f
  write(f, "/tmp/demo.f")
}
</code></pre>

<p>When this app is compiled and run, it will serialize <code>f</code> to &#8220;/tmp/demo.f1&#8221;, which of course includes the value of <code>v</code> as part of the closure for <code>f</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /tmp closures.scala
$ scala -cp /tmp Demo
$ ls /tmp/demo*
/tmp/demo.f
</code></pre>

<p>Now, imagine you wanted to make a straightforward change, where <code>object foo</code> becomes <code>class foo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>object Demo extends App {
  def write[A](obj: A, fname: String) {
    import java.io._
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fname)).writeObject(obj)
  }

  // foo is a class instead of an object
  class foo() {
    val v = 42
    // The returned function includes 'v' in its closure, but also a secret surprise
    def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
  }

  // This will throw an exception!
  val f = new foo().f
  write(f, "/tmp/demo.f")
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would be reasonable to expect that this minor variation behaves exactly as the previous one, but instead it throws an exception!</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /tmp closures.scala
$ scala -cp /tmp Demo
java.io.NotSerializableException: Demo$foo
</code></pre>

<p>If we look at the exception message, we see that it&#8217;s complaining about not knowing how to serialize objects of class <code>foo</code>.  But we weren&#8217;t including any values of <code>foo</code> in the closure for <code>f</code>, only a particular member &#8216;v&#8217;!  What gives?  Scala is not very helpful with diagnosing this problem, but when a class member value shows up in a closure that is defined <em>inside</em> the class body, the <em>entire instance</em>, including any and all other member values, is included in the closure.  Presumably this is because a class may have any number of instances, and the compiler is including the entire instance in the closure to properly resolve the correct member value.</p>

<p>One straightforward way to fix this is to simply make class <code>foo</code> serializable:</p>

<pre><code>class foo() extends Serializable {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you make this change to the above code, the example with <code>class foo</code> now works correctly, but it is working by serializing the entire <code>foo</code> instance, not just the value of <code>v</code>.</p>

<p>In many cases, this is not a problem and will work fine.  Serializing a few additional members may be inexpensive.  In other cases, however, it can be an impractical or impossible option.  For example, <code>foo</code> might include other very large members, which will be expensive or outright impossible to serialize:</p>

<pre><code>class foo() extends Serializable {
  val v = 42    // easy to serialize
  val w = 4.5   // easy to serialize
  val data = (1 to 1000000000).toList  // serialization landmine hiding in your closure

  // The returned function includes all of 'foo' instance in its closure
  def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
}
</code></pre>

<p>A variation on the above problem is class members that are small or moderate in size, but serialized many times.  In this case, the serialization cost can become intractable via repetition of unwanted inclusions.</p>

<p>Another potential problem is class members that are not serializable, and perhaps not under your control:</p>

<pre><code>class foo() extends Serializable {
  import some.class.NotSerializable

  val v = 42                      // easy to serialize
  val x = new NotSerializable     // I'll hide in your closure and fail to serialize

  // The returned function includes all of 'foo' instance in its closure
  def f() = (x: Int) =&gt; v * x
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a relatively painless way to decouple values from their parent instance, so that only desired values are included in a closure.  Passing desired values as parameters to a shim function whose job is to assemble the closure will prevent the parent instance from being pulled into the closure.  In the following example, a shim function named <code>closureFunction</code> is defined for this purpose:</p>

<pre><code>object Demo extends App {
  def write[A](obj: A, fname: String) {
    import java.io._
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fname)).writeObject(obj)
  }

  // apply a generator to create a function with safe decoupled closures
  def closureFunction[E,D,R](enclosed: E)(gen: E =&gt; (D =&gt; R)) = gen(enclosed)

  class NotSerializable {}

  class foo() {
    val v1 = 42
    val v2 = 73
    val n = new NotSerializable

    // use shim function to enclose *only* the values of 'v1' and 'v2'
    def f() = closureFunction((v1, v2)) { enclosed =&gt;
      val (v1, v2) = enclosed
      (x: Int) =&gt; (v1 + v2) * x   // Desired function, with 'v1' and 'v2' enclosed
    }
  }

  // This will work!
  val f = new foo().f
  write(f, "/tmp/demo.f")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Being aware of the scenarios where parent instances are pulled into closures, and how to keep your closures clean, can save some frustration and wasted time.  Happy programming!</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2015/01/24/monadic-break-and-continue-for-scala-sequence-comprehensions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Author&#8217;s note: I&#8217;ve since received some excellent feedback from the Scala community, which I included in some <a href="#notes">end notes</a>.</p>

<p>Author&#8217;s note the 2nd: I later realized I could apply an implicit conversion and mediator class to preserve the traditional ordering: the code has been updated with that approach.</p>

<p>Author&#8217;s note the 3rd: This concept has been submitted to the Scala project as JIRA <a href="https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9120">SI-9120</a> (PR <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4275">#4275</a>)</p>

<p>Scala <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/sequence-comprehensions.html">sequence comprehensions</a> are an excellent functional programming idiom for looping in Scala.  However, sequence comprehensions encompass much more than just looping &#8211; they represent a powerful syntax for manipulating <em>all</em> monadic structures<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> looping constructs are a popular framework for cleanly representing multiple loop halting and continuation conditions at differing stages in the execution flow.  Although there is no native support for <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> in Scala control constructs, it is possible to implement them in a clean and idiomatic way for sequence comprehensions.</p>

<p>In this post I will describe a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> for use in Scala sequence comprehensions (aka <code>for</code> statements).  The entire implementation is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>object BreakableGenerators {
  import scala.language.implicitConversions

  type Generator[+A] = Iterator[A]
  type BreakableGenerator[+A] = BreakableIterator[A]

  // Generates a new breakable generator from any traversable object.
  def breakable[A](t1: TraversableOnce[A]): Generator[BreakableGenerator[A]] =
    List(new BreakableIterator(t1.toIterator)).iterator

  // Mediates boolean expression with 'break' and 'continue' invocations
  case class BreakableGuardCondition(cond: Boolean) {
    // Break the looping over one or more breakable generators, if 'cond' 
    // evaluates to true.
    def break(b: BreakableGenerator[_], bRest: BreakableGenerator[_]*): Boolean = {
      if (cond) {
        b.break
        for (x &lt;- bRest) { x.break }
      }
      !cond
    }

    // Continue to next iteration of enclosing generator if 'cond' 
    // evaluates to true.
    def continue: Boolean = !cond
  }

  // implicit conversion of boolean values to breakable guard condition mediary
  implicit def toBreakableGuardCondition(cond: Boolean) =
    BreakableGuardCondition(cond)

  // An iterator that can be halted via its 'break' method.  Not invoked directly
  class BreakableIterator[+A](itr: Iterator[A]) extends Iterator[A] {
    private var broken = false
    private[BreakableGenerators] def break { broken = true }

    def hasNext = !broken &amp;&amp; itr.hasNext
    def next = itr.next
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The approach is based on a simple subclass of <code>Iterator</code> &#8211; <code>BreakableIterator</code> &#8211; that can be halted by &#8216;breaking&#8217; it.  The function <code>breakable(&lt;traversable-object&gt;)</code> returns an Iterator over a single <code>BreakableIterator</code> object.  Iterators are monad-like structures in that they implement <code>map</code> and <code>flatMap</code>, and so its output can be used with <code>&lt;-</code> at the start of a <code>for</code> construct in the usual way.  Note that this means the result of the <code>for</code> statement will also be an Iterator.</p>

<p>Whenever the boolean expression for an <code>if</code> guard is followed by either <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code>, it is implicitly converted to a &#8220;breakable guard condition&#8221; that supports those methods.  The function <code>break</code> accepts one or more instances of <code>BreakableIterator</code>.  If it evaluates to <code>true</code>, the loops embodied by the given iterators are immediately halted via the associated <code>if</code> guard, and the iterators are halted via their <code>break</code> method.  The <code>continue</code> function is mostly syntactic sugar for a standard <code>if</code> guard, simply with the condition inverted.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> in use:</p>

<pre><code>object Main {
  import BreakableGenerators._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val r = for (
      // generate a breakable sequence from some sequential input
      loop &lt;- breakable(1 to 1000);
      // iterate over the breakable sequence
      j &lt;- loop;
      // print out at each iteration
      _ = { println(s"iteration j= $j") };
      // continue to next iteration when 'j' is even
      if { j % 2 == 0 } continue;
      // break out of the loop when 'j' exceeds 5
      if { j &gt; 5 } break(loop)
    ) yield {
      j
    }
    println(s"result= ${r.toList}")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can see from the resulting output that <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> function in the usual way.  The <code>continue</code> clause ignores all subsequent code when <code>j</code> is even.  The <code>break</code> clause halts the loop when it sees its first value > 5, which is 7.  Only odd values &lt;= 5 are output from the <code>yield</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /home/eje/class monadic_break.scala
$ scala -classpath /home/eje/class Main
iteration j= 1
iteration j= 2
iteration j= 3
iteration j= 4
iteration j= 5
iteration j= 6
iteration j= 7
result= List(1, 3, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Breakable iterators can be nested in the way one would expect.  The following example shows an inner breakable loop nested inside an outer one:</p>

<pre><code>object Main {
  import BreakableGenerators._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val r = for (
      outer &lt;- breakable(1 to 7);
      j &lt;- outer;
      _ = { println(s"outer  j= $j") };
      if { j % 2 == 0 } continue;
      inner &lt;- breakable(List("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"));
      k &lt;- inner;
      _ = { println(s"    inner  j= $j  k= $k") };
      if { k == "d" } break(inner);
      if { j == 5  &amp;&amp;  k == "c" } break(inner, outer)
    ) yield {
      (j, k)
    }
    println(s"result= ${r.toList}")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output demonstrates that the inner loop breaks whenever <code>k=="d"</code>, and so <code>"e"</code> is never present in the <code>yield</code> result.  When <code>j==5</code> and <code>k=="c"</code>, both the inner and outer loops are broken, and so we see that there is no <code>(5,"c")</code> pair in the result, nor does the outer loop ever iterate over 6 or 7:</p>

<pre><code>$ scalac -d /home/eje/class monadic_break.scala
$ scala -classpath /home/eje/class Main
outer  j= 1
    inner  j= 1  k= a
    inner  j= 1  k= b
    inner  j= 1  k= c
    inner  j= 1  k= d
outer  j= 2
outer  j= 3
    inner  j= 3  k= a
    inner  j= 3  k= b
    inner  j= 3  k= c
    inner  j= 3  k= d
outer  j= 4
outer  j= 5
    inner  j= 5  k= a
    inner  j= 5  k= b
    inner  j= 5  k= c
result= List((1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (3,a), (3,b), (3,c), (5,a), (5,b))
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> with <code>BreakableIterator</code> for sequence comprehensions is that easy.  Enjoy!</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<p>The helpful community on freenode #scala made some excellent observations:</p>

<p>1: Iterators in Scala are not strictly monadic &#8211; it would be more accurate to say they&#8217;re &#8220;things with a flatMap and map method, also they can use filter or withFilter sometimes.&#8221;  However, I personally still prefer to think of them as &#8220;monadic in spirit if not law.&#8221;</p>

<p>2: The <code>break</code> function, as described in this post, is not truly functional in the sense of referential transparency, as the invocation <code>if break(loop) { condition }</code> involves a side-effect on the variable <code>loop</code>.  I would say that it does maintain &#8220;scoped functionality.&#8221;  That is, the break in non-referential transparency is scoped by the variables in question.  The <code>for</code> statement containing them is referentially transparent with respect to its inputs (provided no other code is breaking referential transparency, of course).</p>

    <updated>2014-09-11T07:57:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/09/11/faster-random-samples-with-gap-sampling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Update (April 4, 2016): my colleague <a href="http://rnowling.github.io/">RJ Nowling</a> ran across a <a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit87.RandomSampling.pdf">paper by J.S. Vitter</a> that shows Vitter developed the trick of accelerating sampling with a sampling-gap distribution in 1987 &#8211; I re-invented Vitter&#8217;s wheel 30 years after the fact!  I&#8217;m surprised it never caught on, as it is not much harder to implement than the naive version.</p></blockquote>

<p>Generating a random sample of a collection is, logically, a O(np) operation, where (n) is the sample size and (p) is the sampling probability.  For example, extracting a random sample, without replacement, from an array might look like this in pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>sample(data: array, p: real) {
    n = length(data)
    m = floor(p * n)
    for j = 0 to m-1 {
        k = random(j, n-1)
        swap(data[j], data[k])
    }
    emit the first m elements of 'data' to output
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that this sampling algorithm is indeed O(np).  However, it makes some nontrivial assumptions about its input data:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is random access</li>
<li>It is writable</li>
<li>Its size is known</li>
<li>It can be destructively modified</li>
</ul>


<p>These assumptions can be violated in several ways.  The input data might not support random access, for example it might be a list, or stream, or an iterator over the same.  We might not know its size a priori.  It might be read-only.  It might be up-cast to some superclass where knowledge about these assumed properties is no longer available.</p>

<p>In cases such as this, there is another common sampling algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    while not end(data) {
        v = next(data)
        if random(0.0, 1.0) &lt; p then emit v to output
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above algorithm enjoys all the advantage in flexibility.  It requires only linear access, does not require writable input, and makes no assumptions about input size.  However it comes at a price: this algorithm is no longer O(np), it is O(n).  Each element must be traversed directly, and worse yet the random number generagor (RNG) must be invoked on each element.  O(n) invocation of the RNG is a substantial cost &#8211; random number generation is typically very expensive compared to the cost of iterating to the next element in a sequence.</p>

<p>But&#8230; does linear sampling truly require us to invoke our RNG on every element?   Consider the pattern of data access, divorced from code.   It looks like a sequence of choices: for each element we either (skip) or (sample):</p>

<pre><code>(skip) (skip) (sample) (skip) (sample) (skip) (sample) (sample) (skip) (skip) (sample) ...
</code></pre>

<p>The number of consecutive (skip) events between each (sample) &#8211; the <em>sampling gap</em> &#8211; can itself be modeled as a random variable.  Each (skip)/(sample) choice is an independent Bernoulli trial, where the probability of (skip) is (1-p).   The PMF of the sampling gap for gap of {0, 1, 2, &#8230;} is therefore a geometric distribution: P(k) = p(1-p)<sup>k</sup></p>

<p>This suggests an alternative algorithm for sampling, where we only need to randomly choose sample gaps instead of randomly choosing whether we sample each individual element:</p>

<pre><code>// choose a random sampling gap 'k' from P(k) = p(1-p)^k
// caution: this explodes for p = 0 or p = 1
random_gap(p: real) {
    u = max(random(0.0, 1.0), epsilon)
    return floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
}

sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    advance(data, random_gap(p))
    while not end(data) {
        emit next(data) to output
        advance(data, random_gap(p))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above algorithm calls the RNG only once per actual collected sample, and so the cost of RNG calls is O(np).  Note that the algorithm is still O(n), but the cost of the RNG tends to dominate the cost of sequence traversal, and so the resulting efficiency improvement is substantial.  I measured the following performance improvements with gap sampling, compared to traditional linear sequence sampling, on a <a href="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/05db1f15c8d623448ff6">Scala prototype testing rig</a>:</p>

<br>


<p>In the results above, we see that the gap sampling times are essentially linear in (p), as expected.  In the case of the linear-access List type, there is a higher baseline time (230 vs 29) due to the constant cost of actual data traversal.  Efficiency improvements are substantial at small sampling probabilities.</p>

<p>We can also see that the cost of gap sampling begins to meet and then exceed the cost of traditinal linear sampling, in the vicinnity (p) = 0.5.  This is due to the fact that the gap sampling logic is about twice the cost (in my test environment) of simply calling the RNG once.  For example, the gap sampling invokes a call to the numeric logarithm code that isn&#8217;t required in traditional sampling.  And so at (p) = 0.5 the time spent doing the gap sampling approximates the time spent invoking the RNG once per sample, and at higher values of (p) the cost is greater.</p>

<p>This suggests that one should in fact fall back to traditional linear sampling when the sampling probability (p) >= some threshold.  That threshold appears to be about 0.5 or 0.6 in my testing rig, but is likely to depend on underlying numeric libraries, the particular RNG being used, etc, and so I would expect it to benefit from customized tuning on a per-environment basis.  With this in mind, a sample algorithm as deployed would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// threshold is a tuning parameter
threshold = 0.5

sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    if (p &lt; threshold) {
        gap_sample(data, p)
    } else {
        traditional_linear_sample(data, p)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The gap-sampling algorithm described above is for sampling <em>without</em> replacement.   However, the same approach can be modified to generate sampling <em>with</em> replacement.</p>

<p>When sampling with replacement, it is useful to consider the <em>replication factor</em> of each element (where a replication factor of zero means the element wasn&#8217;t sampled).  Pretend for the moment that the actual data size (n) is known.  The sample size (m) = (n)(p).  The probability that each element gets sampled, per trial, is 1/n, with (m) independent trials, and so the replication factor (r) for each element obeys a binomial distribution: Binomial(m, 1/n).  If we substitute (n)(p) for (m), we have Binomial(np, 1/n).  As the (n) grows, the Binomial is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Poisson_approximation">well approximated by a Poisson distribution</a> Poisson(L), where (L) = (np)(1/n) = (p).  And so for our purposes we may sample from Poisson(p), where P(r) = (p<sup>r</sup> / r!)e<sup>(-p),</sup> for our sampling replication factors.  Note that we have now discarded any dependence on sample size (n), as we desire.</p>

<p>In our gap-sampling context, the sampling gaps are now elements whose replication factor is zero, which occurs with probability P(0) = e<sup>(-p).</sup>  And so our sampling gaps are now drawn from geometric distribution P(k) = (1-q)(q)<sup>k,</sup> where q = e<sup>(-p).</sup>   When we <em>do</em> sample an element, its replication factor is drawn from Poisson(p), however <em>conditioned such that the value is >= 1.</em>  It is straightforward to adapt a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Generating_Poisson-distributed_random_variables">standard Poisson generator</a>, as shown below.</p>

<p>Given the above, gap sampling with replacement in pseudocode looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// sample 'k' from Poisson(p), conditioned to k &gt;= 1
poisson_ge1(p: real) {
    q = e^(-p)
    // simulate a poisson trial such that k &gt;= 1
    t = q + (1-q)*random(0.0, 1.0)
    k = 1

    // continue standard poisson generation trials
    t = t * random(0.0, 1.0)
    while (t &gt; q) {
        k = k + 1
        t = t * random(0.0, 1.0)
    }
    return k
}

// choose a random sampling gap 'k' from P(k) = p(1-p)^k
// caution: this explodes for p = 0 or p = 1
random_gap(p: real) {
    u = max(random(0.0, 1.0), epsilon)
    return floor(log(u) / -p)
}

sample(data: sequence, p: real) {
    advance(data, random_gap(p))
    while not end(data) {
        rf = poisson_ge1(p)
        v = next(data)
        emit (rf) copies of (v) to output
        advance(data, random_gap(p))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As with the results for sampling without replacement, we see that gap sampling cost is linear with (p), which yields large cost savings at small sampling, but begins to exceed traditional linear sampling at higher sampling probabilities.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Scala Iterator <code>drop</code> method has a complexity bug that shows up when one calls <code>drop</code> repeatedly, for example when traversing over an iterator in a loop.</p>

<p>The nature of the problem is that <code>drop</code>, under the hood, invokes <code>slice</code>, which returns a new anonymous subclass of <code>AbstractIterator</code> containing an instance of the input class, which can be seen in this <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/scala/blob/scala_drop_blog/src/library/scala/collection/Iterator.scala#L323">code excerpt from Iterator.scala</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def drop(n: Int): Iterator[A] = slice(n, Int.MaxValue)

// ... comments excised ...

def slice(from: Int, until: Int): Iterator[A] = {
  val lo = from max 0
  var toDrop = lo
  while (toDrop &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; self.hasNext) {
    self.next()
    toDrop -= 1
  }

  // I am a ticking quadratic time bomb:
  new AbstractIterator[A] {
    private var remaining = until - lo
    def hasNext = remaining &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; self.hasNext
    def next(): A =
      if (remaining &gt; 0) {
        remaining -= 1
        self.next()
      }
      else empty.next()
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case where one is only calling <code>drop</code> once, this is not very consequential, but when the same method is used in a loop, the nesting is repeated, generating a nesting of anonymous classes that is ever-deeper &#8211; rather like Matryoshka dolls:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/matryoshka.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>This can be a substantial problem, as it generates quadratic complexity in what is logically a linear operation.  A simple example of looping code that can cause this nesting:</p>

<pre><code>def process_nth_elements[T](itr: Iterator[T], n: Int = 1) {
  var iter = itr
  while (iter.hasNext) {
    val nxt = iter.next
    // ... process next element ...

    // skip to next element
    iter = iter.drop(n-1)
    // this becomes more and more expensive as iterator classes
    // become nested deeper
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A simple example program, which can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/a310ccd3c58a85f031dc">found here</a>, demonstrates this nesting directly:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.{StringWriter, PrintWriter}
import scala.reflect.ClassTag

def tracehead(e: Exception, substr: String = "slice"): String = {
  val sw = new StringWriter()
  e.printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(sw))
  sw.toString.split('\n').takeWhile((s:String)=&gt; !s.contains(substr)).drop(1).mkString("\n")  
}

class TestIterator[T: ClassTag](val iter: Iterator[T]) extends Iterator[T] {
  override def hasNext = iter.hasNext
  override def next = {
    println(tracehead(new Exception))
    iter.next
  }
}

def drop_test[T](itr: Iterator[T]) {
  var n = 0
  var iter = itr
  while (iter.hasNext) {
    n += 1
    println(s"\ndrop # $n")
    iter = iter.drop(1)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the <code>drop_test</code> function is run on an instance of <code>TestIterator</code>, the stack trace output shows the Matryoshka nesting directly:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; drop_test(new TestIterator(List(1,2,3,4,5).iterator))

drop # 1

</code></pre>

<p>One would expect this quadratic behavior to show up in benchmarking, and it does.  Consider this simple timing test:</p>

<pre><code>def drop_time[T](itr: Iterator[T]) {
  val t0 = System.currentTimeMillis()
  var iter = itr
  while (iter.hasNext) {
    iter = iter.drop(1)
  }
  println(s"Time: ${System.currentTimeMillis() - t0}")
}
</code></pre>

<p>One would expect this function to be linear in the length of the iterator, but we see the following behavior:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 1).toList.iterator)
Time: 106

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 2).toList.iterator)
Time: 475

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 3).toList.iterator)
Time: 1108

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 4).toList.iterator)
Time: 2037

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 5).toList.iterator)
Time: 3234

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 6).toList.iterator)
Time: 4717

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 7).toList.iterator)
Time: 6447

scala&gt; drop_time((1 to 5000 * 8).toList.iterator)
java.lang.StackOverflowError
    at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$10.next(Iterator.scala:312)
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding plot shows the quadratic cost:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/matryoshka_quadratic_plot.png" alt="&quot;image&quot;" /></p>

<p>Given the official semantics of <code>drop</code>, which state that the method invalidates the iterator it was called on, this nesting problem should be avoidable by implementing the method more like this:</p>

<pre><code>def drop(n: Int): Iterator[A] = {
  var j = 0
  while (j &lt; n) {
    this.next
    j += 1
  }
  this
}

    <updated>2014-08-12T11:37:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/08/12/implementing-parallel-prefix-scan-as-a-spark-rdd-transform</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/08/09/implementing-an-rdd-scanleft-transform-with-cascade-rdds/">previous post</a>, I described how to implement the Scala <code>scanLeft</code> function as an RDD transform.  By definition <code>scanLeft</code> invokes a sequential-only prefix scan algorithm; it does not assume that either its input function <code>f</code> or its initial-value <code>z</code> can be applied in a parallel fashion.   Its companion function <code>scan</code>, however, computes a <em>parallel</em> prefix scan.  In this post I will describe an implementation of parallel prefix <code>scan</code> as an RDD transform.</p>

<p>As was the case with <code>scanLeft</code>, a basic strategy is to begin by applying <code>scan</code> to each RDD partition.  Provided that appropriate &#8220;offsets&#8221; <code>{z1, z2, ...}</code> can be computed for each partition, these can be applied to the partial, per-partition results to yield the output.   In fact, the desired <code>{z1, z2, ...}</code> are the parallel prefix scan of the last element in each per-partition scan.  The following diagram illustrates:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_scan/rdd_scan_4.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The diagram above glosses over the details of computing <code>scan</code> to obtain <code>{z1, z2, ...}</code>.   I will first describe the implementation I currently use, and then also discuss a possible alternative.  The current implementation takes the approach of encoding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum#Parallel_algorithm">logic of a parallel prefix scan</a> directly into an RDD computation DAG.   Each iteration, or &#8220;ply,&#8221; of the parallel algorithm is represented by an RDD.  Each element resides in its own partition, and so the computation dependency for each element is directly representable in the RDD dependency substructure.  This construction is illustrated in the following schematic (for a vector of 8 z-values):</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_scan/rdd_scan_5.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The parallel prefix scan algorithm executes O(log(n)) plies, which materializes as O(log(n)) RDDs shown in the diagram above.  In this context, (n) is the number of input RDD <em>partitions</em>, not to be confused with the number of data rows in the RDD.   There are O((n)log(n)) partitions, each having a single row containing the z-value for a corresponding output partition.   Some z-values are determined earlier than others.  For example z1 is immediately available in ply(0), and ply(3) can refer directly back to that ply(0) partition in the interest of efficiency, as called out by the red DAG arcs.</p>

<p>This scheme allows each final output partition to obtain its z-value directly from a single dedicated partition, which ensures that minimal data needs to be transferred across worker processes.  Final output partitions can be computed local to their corresponding input partitions.  Data transfer may be limited to the intermediate z-values, which are small single-row affairs by construction.</p>

<p>The code implementing the logic above can be <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/rdd_scan_blog/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/ScanRDDFunctions.scala#L161">viewed here.</a></p>

<p>I will conclude by noting that there is an alternative to this highly distributed computation of <code>{z1, z2, ...}</code>, which is to collect the last-values in the per-partition intermediate scan ouputs into a single array, and run <code>scan</code> directly on that array.   This has the advantage of avoiding the construction of log(n) intermediate RDDs.   It does, however, require a monolithic &#8216;fan-in&#8217; of data into a single RDD to receive the collection of values.  That is followed by a fan-out of the array, where each output partition picks its single z-value from the array.  It is for this reason I suspect this alternative incurs substantially more transfer overhead across worker processes.  However, one might also partition the resulting z-values in some optimal way, so that each final output partition needs to request only the partition that contains its z-value.  Future experimentation might show that this can out-perform the current fully-distributed implementation.</p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/08/09/implementing-an-rdd-scanleft-transform-with-cascade-rdds/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-09T09:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/08/09/implementing-an-rdd-scanleft-transform-with-cascade-rdds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Scala, sequence (and iterator) data types support the <code>scanLeft</code> method for computing a sequential prefix scan on sequence elements:</p>

<pre><code>// Use scanLeft to compute the cumulative sum of some integers
scala&gt; List(1, 2, 3).scanLeft(0)(_ + _)
res0: List[Int] = List(0, 1, 3, 6)
</code></pre>

<p>Spark RDDs are logically a sequence of row objects, and so <code>scanLeft</code> is in principle well defined on RDDs.  In this post I will describe how to cleanly implement a <code>scanLeft</code> RDD transform by applying an RDD variation called Cascade RDDs.</p>

<p>A Cascade RDD is an RDD having one partition which is a function of an input RDD partition and an optional predecessor Cascade RDD partition.  You can see that this definition is somewhat recursive, where the basis case is a Cascade RDD having no precedessor.  The following diagram illustrates both cases of Cascade RDD:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_scanleft/rdd_scan_1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As implied by the above diagram, a series of Cascade RDDs falling out of an input RDD will have as many Cascade RDDs as there are input partitions.  This situation begs for an abstraction to re-assemble the cascade back into a single output RDD, and so the method <code>cascadePartitions</code> is defined, as illustrated:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_scanleft/rdd_scan_3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The <code>cascadePartitions</code> method takes a function argument <code>f</code>, with the signature:</p>

<pre><code>f(input: Iterator[T], cascade: Option[Iterator[U]]): Iterator[U]
</code></pre>

<p>in a manner somewhat analogous to <code>mapPartitions</code>.  The function <code>f</code> must address the fact that <code>cascade</code> is optional and will be <code>None</code> in case where there is no predecessor Cascade RDD.  The interested reader can examine the details of how the <code>CascadeRDD</code> class and its companion method <code>cascadePartitions</code> are <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/rdd_scan_blog/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/CascadeRDDFunctions.scala">implemented here.</a></p>

<p>With Cascade RDDs it is now straightforward to define a <code>scanLeft</code> transform for RDDs.  We wish to run <code>scanLeft</code> on each input partition, with the condition that we want to start where the previous input partition left off.  The Scala <code>scanLeft</code> function makes this easy, as the starting point is its first parameter (z): <code>scanLeft(z)(f)</code>.  The following figure illustrates what this looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_scanleft/rdd_scan_2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As the above schematic demonstrates, almost all the work is accomplished with a single call to <code>cascadePartitions</code>, using a thin wrapper around <code>f</code> which determines where to start the next invocation of Scala <code>scanLeft</code> &#8211; either the input parameter <code>z</code>, or the last output element of the previous cascade.   One final transform must be applied to remove the initial element that Scala <code>scanLeft</code> inserts into its output, excepting the first output partition, where it is kept to be consistent with the <code>scanLeft</code> definition.</p>

<p>All computation is accomplished in the standard RDD formalism, and so <code>scanLeft</code> is a proper lazy RDD transform.</p>

<p>The actual implementation is as compact as the above description implies, and you can see the <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/rdd_scan_blog/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/ScanRDDFunctions.scala#L144">code here.</a></p>

    <link href="http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/07/29/deferring-spark-actions-to-lazy-transforms-with-the-promise-rdd/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-29T13:53:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/07/29/deferring-spark-actions-to-lazy-transforms-with-the-promise-rdd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/07/27/some-implications-of-supporting-the-scala-drop-method-for-spark-rdds/">previous post</a> I described a method for implementing the Scala <code>drop</code> transform for Spark RDDs.  That implementation came at a cost of subverting the RDD lazy transform model; it forced the computation of one or more input RDD partitions at call time instead of deferring partition computation, and so behaved more like a Spark action than a transform.</p>

<p>In this followup post I will describe how to implement <code>drop</code> as a true lazy RDD transform, using a new RDD subclass: the Promise RDD.  A Promise RDD can be used to embed computations in the lazy transform formalism that otherwise would require non-lazy actions.</p>

<p>The Promise RDD (aka <code>PromiseRDD</code> subclass) is designed to encapsulate a single expression value in an RDD having exactly one row, to be evaluated <em>only</em> if and when its single partition is computed. It behaves somewhat analogously to a Scala <code>promise</code> structure, as it abstracts the expression such that any requests for its value (and hence its actual computation) may be deferred.</p>

<p>The definition of PromiseRDD is compact:</p>

<pre><code>class PromisePartition extends Partition {
  // A PromiseRDD has exactly one partition, by construction:
  override def index = 0
}

/**
 * A way to represent the concept of a promised expression as an RDD, so that it
 * can operate naturally inside the lazy-transform formalism
 */
class PromiseRDD[V: ClassTag](expr: =&gt; (TaskContext =&gt; V),
                              context: SparkContext, deps: Seq[Dependency[_]])
  extends RDD[V](context, deps) {

  // This RDD has exactly one partition by definition, since it will contain
  // a single row holding the 'promised' result of evaluating 'expr' 
  override def getPartitions = Array(new PromisePartition)

  // compute evaluates 'expr', yielding an iterator over a sequence of length 1:
  override def compute(p: Partition, ctx: TaskContext) = List(expr(ctx)).iterator
}
</code></pre>

<p>A PromiseRDD is constructed with the expression of choice, embodied as a function from a <code>TaskContext</code> to the implied expression type.   Note that <em>only</em> the task context is a parameter;  Any other inputs needed to evaluate the expression must be present in the closure of <code>expr</code>.  This allows the expression to be of very general form: its value may depend on a single input RDD, or multiple RDDs, or no RDDs at all.  It receives an arbitrary sequence of partition dependencies which is the responsibility of the calling code to assemble.  Again, this allows substantial generality in the form of the expression: the PromiseRDD dependencies can correspond to any arbitrary input dependencies assumed by the expression.  The dependencies can be tuned to exactly what input partitions are required.</p>

<p>As a motivating example, consider how a PromiseRDD can be used to promote <code>drop</code> to a true lazy transform.  The aspect of computing <code>drop</code> that threatens laziness is the necessity of determining the location of the boundary partition (<a href="http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2014/07/27/some-implications-of-supporting-the-scala-drop-method-for-spark-rdds/">see previous discussion</a>).  However, this portion of the computation can in fact be encapsulated in a PromiseRDD.  The details of constructing such a PromiseRDD can be <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/blob/promise_rdd_blog/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/DropRDDFunctions.scala#L46">viewed here</a>.  The following illustration summarizes the topology of the dependency DAG that is constructed:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd_drop_promise.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As the dependency diagram shows, the PromiseRDD responsible for locating the boundary partition depends on each partition of the original input RDD.  The actual computation is likely to only request the first input partition, but all partitions might be required to handle all possible arguments to <code>drop</code>.   In turn, the location information given by the PromiseRDD is depended upon by each output partition.  Input partitions are either passed to the output, or used to compute the boundary, and so none of the partition computation is wasted.</p>

<p>Observe that the scheduler remains in charge of when partitions are computed.  An advantage to using a PromiseRDD is that it works within Spark&#8217;s computational model, instead of forcing it.</p>

<p>The following brief example demonstrates that <code>drop</code> implemented using a PromiseRDD satisfies the lazy transform model:</p>

<pre><code>// create data rdd with values 0 thru 9
scala&gt; val data = sc.parallelize(0 until 10)
data: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Int] = ParallelCollectionRDD[0] at parallelize at &lt;console&gt;:12

// drop the first 3 rows
// note that no action is performed -- this transform is lazy
scala&gt; val rdd = data.drop(3)
rdd: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Int] = $anon$1[2] at drop at &lt;console&gt;:14

// collect the values.  This action kicks off job scheduling and execution
scala&gt; rdd.collect
14/07/28 12:16:13 INFO SparkContext: Starting job: collect at &lt;console&gt;:17
... job scheduling and execution output ...

res0: Array[Int] = Array(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

scala&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this post, I have described the Promise RDD, an RDD subclass that can be used to encapsulate computations in the lazy transform formalism that would otherwise require non-lazy actions.  As an example, I have outlined a lazy transform implementation of <code>drop</code> that uses PromiseRDD.</p>

    <id>http://erikerlandson.github.com/blog/2014/07/27/some-implications-of-supporting-the-scala-drop-method-for-spark-rdds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Scala, sequence data types support the <code>drop</code> method for skipping (aka &#8220;dropping&#8221;) the first elements of the sequence:</p>

<pre><code>// drop the first element of a list
scala&gt; List(1, 2, 3).drop(1)
res1: List[Int] = List(2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Spark RDDs also support various standard sequence methods, for example <code>filter</code>, as they are logically a sequence of row objects.  One might suppose that <code>drop</code> could be a useful sequence method for RDDs, as it would support useful idioms like:</p>

<pre><code>// Use drop (hypothetically) to skip the header of a text file:
val data = sparkContext.textFile("data.txt").drop(1)
</code></pre>

<p>Implementing <code>drop</code> for RDDs is possible, and in fact can be done with a <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/compare/erikerlandson:rdd_drop_blogpost_base...rdd_drop_blogpost">small amount of code</a>, however it comes at the price of an impact to the RDD lazy computing model.</p>

<p>To see why, recall that RDDs are composed of partitions, and so in order to drop the first (n) rows of an RDD, one must first identify the partition that contains the (n-1),(n) row boundary.  In the resulting RDD, this partition will be the first one to contain any data.  Identifying this &#8220;boundary&#8221; partition cannot have a closed-form solution, because partition sizes are not in general equal;  the partition interface does not even support the concept of a <code>count</code> method.  In order to obtain the size of a partition, one is forced to actually compute its contents.  The diagram below illustrates one example of why this is so &#8211; the contents of the partitions in the filtered RDD on the right cannot be known without actually running the filter on the parent RDD:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd-drop-1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Given all this, the structure of a <code>drop</code> implementation is to compute the first partition, find its length, and see if it contains the requested (n-1),(n) boundary.  If not, compute the next partition, and so on, until the boundary partition is identified.  All prior partitions are ignored in the result.  All subsequent partitions are passed on with no change.  The boundary partition is passed through its own <code>drop</code> to eliminate rows up to (n).</p>

<p>The code implementing the concept described above can be viewed here:
<a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/compare/erikerlandson:rdd_drop_blogpost_base...rdd_drop_blogpost">https://github.com/erikerlandson/spark/compare/erikerlandson:rdd_drop_blogpost_base&#8230;rdd_drop_blogpost</a></p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the relation between input and output partitions in a call to <code>drop</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd-drop-2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Arguably, this represents a potential subversion of the RDD lazy compute model, as it forces the computation of at least one (and possibly more) partitions.  It behaves like a &#8220;partial action&#8221;, instead of a transform, but an action that returns another RDD.</p>

<p>In many cases, the impact of this might be relatively small.  For example, dropping the first few rows in a text file is likely to only force computation of a single partition, and it is a partition that will eventually be computed anyway.  Furthermore, such a use case is generally not inside a tight loop.</p>

<p>However, it is not hard to construct cases where computing even the first partition of one RDD recursively forces the computation of <em>all</em> the partitions in its parents, as in this example:</p>

<p><img src="http://erikerlandson.github.com/assets/images/rdd_drop/rdd-drop-3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Whether the benefits of supporting <code>drop</code> for RDDs outweigh the costs is an open question.  It is likely to depend on whether or not the Spark community yields any compelling use cases for <code>drop</code>, and whether a transform that behaves like a &#8220;partial action&#8221; is considered an acceptable addition to the RDD formalism.</p>

<p>RDD support for <code>drop</code> has been proposed as issue <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2315">SPARK-2315</a>, with corresponding pull request <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1254/">1254</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The O(ND) edit distance algorithm <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> is a standard for efficient computation of the edit distance between two sequences, appearing in applications such as the GNU diff tool.  There is also a variation <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> that operates in O(NP) time, where P is the number of deletions in the shortest edit path, and which has lower computational complexity, since P &lt;= D (and may be &lt;&lt; D in some circumstances).  In order to apply these algorithms to obtain an <em>edit script</em> in linear space, they must be adapted into a bidirectional form that enables recursive divide-and-conquer.   The basic principles of a bidirectional adaptation of the O(ND) algorithm are described in <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.   However, no such discussion of a bidirectional O(NP) algorithm is provided in <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.  Understanding this adaptation involves some observations that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious.  In this post, I will describe these key observations.</p>

<h3>Notation</h3>

<p>My code segments are written as C/C++, however written in a simplified style I hope will be clear regardless of what languages the reader is familiar with.  If you wish to port this (pseudo-ish)code, it may be worth keeping in mind that indexing is zero-based in C/C++.</p>

<h3>Sequence Lengths</h3>

<p>A brief note on the O(NP) algorithm and sequence lengths: the algorithm assumes that the length of its second sequence argument is >= its first (that is, N >= M).   In the following discussions, I will be making the same assumption, however the modification to address N &lt; M is relatively easy, and can be seen in the references to actual source code below.</p>

<h3>Indexing</h3>

<p>A note on naming:  In <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, the authors use &#8216;fp&#8217; for the name of the array holding path endpoints.  I will use &#8216;Vf&#8217; for the array holding forward endpoints, and &#8216;Vr&#8217; for the corresponding array holding reverse endpoints.</p>

<p>The O(ND) and O(NP) algorithms operate by iteratively extending the frontier of edit paths through the implicit graph of possible paths, where each iteration is computed as a function of the previous.  In the O(NP) algorithm, this computation has to proceed from the outside in, as described in the paper:</p>

<pre><code>for (k = -P;  k &lt; delta;  k += 1) {
    y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
    Vf[k] = snake(y-k, y);
}
for (k = P + delta;  k &gt;= delta;  k -= 1) {
    y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
    Vf[k] = snake(y-k, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to implement a bi-directional algorithm, we must also run the algorithm in reverse, beginning at the &#8220;lower right corner&#8221; of the graph (M,N) and working backward to the origin (0,0).  The indexing is the mirror image of the above:</p>

<pre><code>for (k = P+delta;  k &gt; 0;  k -= 1) {
    y = min(Vr[k-1], Vr[k+1] - 1);
    Vr[k] = rsnake(y-k, y);
}
for (k = -P;  k &lt;= 0;  k += 1) {
    y = min(Vr[k-1], Vr[k+1] - 1);
    Vr[k] = rsnake(y-k, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, &#8216;rsnake&#8217; is the reverse-direction snake function.  A note on initialization:  whereas the forward algorithm initializes its Vf array to (-1), the symmetric initial value for the reverse algorithm Vr array is (N+1) (In the general case, 1 plus the length of the longest sequence).</p>

<h3>Detecting Path Overlap</h3>

<p>The uni-directional O(NP) algorithm halts when Vf[delta] == N.  However, the bi-directional algorithms halt when shortest opposing paths meet &#8211; or overlap &#8211; each other, as described in the O(ND) paper <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.  The semantics of storing paths in working arrays is the same in both algorithms, with the exception that in the O(NP) algorithm it is the (y) values that are stored.  Myers describes the predicate for detecting meeting paths in O(ND) as: (x >= u)  &amp;&amp;  (x-y == u-v), where (x,y) are forward endpoints and (u,v) are reverse endpoints.  Observe that since y = x-k, then (x-y == u-v) is equivalent to &#8220;forward-k == reverse-k&#8221;.  However, in operation one always checks the opposing path with the <em>same</em> k index, and so this clause is redundant.  It is sufficient to check that (x >= u), or in the case of O(NP), that (y >= v).  In the code, this looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
    // overlapping paths detected 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The other checks for forward and reverse are similar.  Note that these checks happen at the <em>beginning</em> of each &#8216;snake&#8217;, that is prior to invoking the snake extension logic.  The semantic is that the opposing path overlaps the run (snake) one is about to start.</p>

<h3>Computing Distance</h3>

<p>When two overlapping paths are detected, we must compute the path distance associated with their union.  In the O(ND) algorithm, we know that distance implicitly, as the paths are extended over successive iterations of D.  In the O(NP) algorithm, however, the current path endpoints are associated with a particular value of P, and so we must consider how to obtain the actual distance.</p>

<p>A little algebra comes to the rescue.  At iteration P, consider the number of deletions along the forward-path at the kth endpoint, which I will denote as &#8216;vf&#8217; (the authors refer to it as V(x,y)).  In <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, the authors show that P == vf when k &lt; delta, and P == vf+k-delta, when k > delta (note that either formula applies for k == delta).  Solving for vf, we have:   vf == P for k &lt; delta and vf == P+delta-k for k > delta.  The authors also show that: vf = (df-k)/2, where df is the total edit distance along the path up to the current endpoint (the authors refer to df as D(x,y)).   Therefore, we have: df = 2(vf)+k, where we can obtain vf from the expression we just derived.</p>

<p>It remains to derive the expressions for the reverse direction, where we want &#8216;vr&#8217; and &#8216;dr&#8217;.  Here, I note that the mirror-image indexing of the reverse algorithm implies that the expressions above work if we transform k &#8211;> delta-k.  Making that transform gives us:   vr == P for k > 0 and vr == P+k for k &lt; 0 (again, either applies for k == 0).  And dr = 2(vr)+delta-k.</p>

<p>And so the actual edit distance covered by our overlapping paths is:  d == (df+dr) == 2(vf+vr)+delta.  Note now pleasing this is, as vf+vr is the number of deletions of the combined paths, and so this corresponds to the original formula D == 2P+delta, where P is the number of deletions over the entire pathway.  We also see from the above that at a given Pth iteration, P does <em>not</em> equal the number of deletions in all paths with endpoints at the current iteration.  The true number of deletions for a given endpoint is a function of P, k and delta.</p>

<p>A note on implementation: when one is advancing forward paths, an overlapping reverse-path will be from previous iteration (P-1), as the reverse paths for (P) have not happened yet.  That will show up in the distance formula for (vr) by using (P-1) in place of P, as in this example code:</p>

<pre><code>y = max(Vf[k-1] + 1, Vf[k+1]);
if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
    // we found overlapping path, so compute corresponding edit distance
    vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
    // use (P-1) for reverse paths:
    vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P-1 + k) : P-1;
    d = 2*(vf+vr)+delta;
}

// ....

y = min(Vr[k-1], Vr[k+1] - 1);
if (y &lt;= Vf[k]) {
    // we can use P for both since forward-paths have been advanced:
    vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
    vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P + k) : P;
    d = 2*(vf+vr)+delta;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Shortest Path</h3>

<p>With respect to halting conditions, the O(NP) algorithm differs in one imporant way from the O(ND) algorithm: The O(ND) algorithm maintains path endpoints corresponding to increasing <em>distance</em> (D) values.  Therefore, when two paths meet, they form a shortest-distance path by definition, and the algorithm can halt on the first such overlap it detects.</p>

<p>The same is <em>not true</em> for the O(NP) algorithm.  It stores endpoints at a particular P value.  However, at a given value of P, actual <em>distances</em> may vary considerably.  On a given iteration over P, actual path distances may vary from 2(P-1)+delta up to 4P+delta.</p>

<p>This problem is dealt with by maintaining a best-known distance, &#8216;Dbest&#8217;, which is initialized to its maximum possible value of N+M, the sum of both sequence lengths.  Whenever two overlapping paths are detected, their corresponding distance &#8216;d&#8217; is computed as described earlier, and the running minimum is maintainted:  Dbest = min(Dbest,d).  As mentioned above, we know that the mimimum possible distance at a given iteration is Dmin = 2(P-1)+delta, and so when Dmin >= Dbest, we halt and return Dbest as our result.</p>

<h3>Loop Bounding</h3>

<p>Some important computational efficiency can be obtained by reorganizing the looping over the endpoints.   As mentioned above, conceptually the looping proceeds from the outside, inward.  Suppose we organize the looping over k values such that we explore k = {-P, P+delta, -P+1, P+delta-1, -P+2, P+delta-2 &#8230; }  Note that the symmetry breaks a bit when we get to k==delta, as here we stop iterating backward, but continue iterating forward until we hit delta from below.  In the code, this looping pattern looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>// advance forward paths: reverse path looping is similar
for (ku = -P, kd = P+delta;  ku &lt;= delta;  ku += 1) {
    // advance diagonals from -P, upwards:
    y = max(1+Vf[ku-1], Vf[ku+1]);

    // check for overlapping path

    Vf[ku] = snake(y-ku, y);

    // stop searching backward past here:
    if (kd &lt;= delta) continue;

    // advance diagonals from P+delta, downwards:
    y = max(1+Vf[kd-1], Vf[kd+1]);

    // check for overlapping path

    Vf[kd] = snake(y-kd, y);
    kd -= 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is method to this madness.  Observe that for any particular P value, the smallest edit distances are at the outside, and get larger as one moves inward.  The minimum distance 2P+delta is always when k == -P, and k == P+delta.  As we proceed inward, the corresponding edit distance increases towards its maximum of 4P+delta.   This allows <em>two</em> optimizations.  The first is that if we hit an overlapping path, we can now exit the loop immediately, as we know that any other such overlapping paths to our inside will have a larger edit distance, and so do not need to be considered.</p>

<p>The second optimization is to recall that path distances are a function of P, k and delta.  We can use this information to solve for k and obtain a useful adaptive bound on how far we loop.  From previous sections, also recall we are keeping a best-known distance Dbest.  We know that we do not have to explore any paths whose distance is >= Dbest.  So, we can set up the following inequality: 2(vf+vr)+delta &lt; Dbest, where vf = P, and vr = (P-1)+k, where k &lt; 0, which is the region where distance is growing.  Therefore, we have 2(P+(P-1)+k)+delta &lt; Dbest.  Solving for k, we have:  k &lt; ((Dbest-delta)/2)-2P+1.  The looping wants to use &#8216;&lt;=&#8217;, so we can rewrite as: k &lt;= ((Dbest-delta-1)/2)-2P+1.  For the reverse-path looping, we can set up a similar inequality:  2(P+P+delta-k)+delta &lt; Dbest, which yields:  k >= ((1+delta-Dbest)/2)+delta+2P.</p>

<p>Note that if these bound expressions evaluate to a value past the nominal bound, then the nominal bound remains in effect: e.g. the operative forward looping bound = min(delta, ((Dbest-delta)/2)-2P).   Also note that these constraints do not break the computation of the endpoints, because when the bounds move, they always retreat toward the outside by 2 on each iteration of P.  Since computation proceeds outside in, that means the necessary values are always correctly populated from the previous iteration.</p>

<p>In the code, the forward path looping looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>// compute our adaptive loop bound (using P-1 for reverse)
bound = min(delta, ((Dbest-delta-1)/2)-(2*P)+1);

// constrain our search by bound:
for (ku = -P, kd = P+delta;  ku &lt;= bound;  ku += 1) {
    y = max(1+Vf[ku-1], Vf[ku+1]);
    if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
        vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
        vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P-1 + k) : P-1;

        // maintain minimum distance:
        Dbest = min(Dbest, 2*(vf+vr)+delta);

        // we can now halt this loop immediately:
        break;
    }

    Vf[ku] = snake(y-ku, y);

    if (kd &lt;= delta) continue;

    y = max(1+Vf[kd-1], Vf[kd+1]);
    if (y &gt;= Vr[k]) {
        vf = (k&gt;delta) ? (P + delta - k) : P;
        vr = (k&lt;0) ? (P-1 + k) : P-1;

        // maintain minimum distance:
        Dbest = min(Dbest, 2*(vf+vr)+delta);

        // we can now halt this loop immediately:
        break;
    }

    Vf[kd] = snake(y-kd, y);
    kd -= 1;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>In conclusion, I will display a code segment with all of the ideas presented above, coming together.  This segment was taken from my <a href="https://github.com/erikerlandson/algorithm/blob/order_np_alg/include/boost/algorithm/sequence/detail/edit_distance.hpp#L342">working prototype code</a>, with some syntactic clutter removed and variable names changed to conform a bit more closely to <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.  The implementation of O(NP) below is performing about 25% faster than the corresponding O(ND) algorithm in my benchmarking tests, and also uses substantially less memory.</p>

<pre><code>// initialize this with the maximum possible distance:
Dbest = M+N;

P = 0;

    // if the minimum possible distance is &gt;= our best-known distance, we can halt
    if (Dmin &gt;= Dbest) return Dbest;

    // adaptive bound for the forward looping
    bound = min(delta, ((Dbest-delta-1)/2)-(2*P)+1);
